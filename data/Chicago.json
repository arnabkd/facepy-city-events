Please post all your pictures and videos in this event as well as our facebook pages. Please chat in this event and continue to post. \n\nI hope everyone is ready for round 2. There are many world protests happening on May 1, 2014. So I think we should join them all. Let us make it our goal on May 1, 2014 to get out and protest once again to help wake up the masses. At this point that is what the protests are doing in many places. Getting us out in the public and the public asking questions so we can educate them. It shows them not to be afraid to get out and protest. With each protest our numbers are growing. Once we have the numbers on our side, the change we seek will follow. \n\nOnce again the focus will be on world wide government corruption. Our goal is to wake up and educate the masses with this 4 day protest. Be peaceful and Loud! \n\nOnce again let us unite all groups for this event. Every one is welcome.\n\nTHIS TIME IT IS A 4 DAY EVENT TO REALLY WAKE UP THE MASSES. NOT EVERYONE CAN BE THERE ALL FOUR DAYS BUT PLEASE COME OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DURING THE 4 DAY EVENT!\n\n\nPeace and respect to everyone.",

There are still tickets, but there might not be any left at the door, get yours now!!  http://www.citywinery.com/chicago/tickets/ian-maksin-4-14.html\n\nIan Maksin is back to City Winery with an all-new program ranging from two world premieres of contemporary classical pieces to a brand new set of jazzy renditions of modern pop songs. This time he will throw in  a couple of extra treats: turning cello into a whole orchestra with a loop pedal as well as singing some of his favorite ballads in different languages...   He will be joined by guest artists, Bulgarian pianist Ani Gogova and Romanian guitarist Gabriel Datcu.\n\nCellist and composer Ian Maksin has gained international recognition for his beautiful tone and distinctive style, as well as his uniquely charismatic way with the audience.  He performs over 100 concerts annually in the USA and Europe, and his performances have been broadcast on NPR, PBS as well as on national radio and television in many European countries.  In Chicago, Maksin has been a frequent guest on WFMT, WBEZ and Chicago Tonight, his performances appear regularly as \u201cCritic\u2019s Pick\u201d in Chicago Tribune as well as the Time Out Magazine.  In 2012 he was named \u201cCitizen Musician\u201d by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for his contribution to the city\u2019s musical life and community engagement.   Apart from being recognized as one of the leading classical artists, Maksin has taken the cello well outside its conventional scope and plays jazz, world music, blues, flamenco, rock, R&B, pop, and has collaborated with such artists as Sting, Andrea Bocelli, P. Diddy, Snoop Dogg and Gloria Estefan.\n\nOfficial Website: www.ianmaksin.com\nFacebook Fanpage:  www.facebook.com/CelloMaxx\nYouTube Channel: www.youtube.com/leftseat75\nTwitter:  www.twitter.com/IanMaksin",

We can conquer this disease in our lifetime and leave an AIDSless world for those who follow us. I ride because people I love are battling this illness and face stigma daily. \n\nI don't have AIDS.  I am not HIV Positive.  Nobody in my family is Positive.  Yet from June 1-7, 2014, I'm bicycling in my 5th AIDS/LifeCycle. It's a 7-day, 545-mile bike ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles to make a world of difference in the lives of people living with HIV and AIDS. \n\nA month later, We will be riding a 200 miles in two days from on July 12th and 13th from Chicago to Wisconsin in a effort to raise much need funds for TPAN (Test Positive Aware Network).\n\nHelp me fight this ENDABLE PANDEMIC!\n\nHIV/AIDS has affected so many friends in my life.  Truth is that when I did my first ride, from Minneapolis to Chicago, in 2002, I didn't know anyone who had HIV nor did I really know anyone who had been affected by it.  But since my first training rides I have become close with many people affected by this ENDABLE PANDEMIC.\n\nI'm attempting to raise the most money I have ever raised with every single penny going to the SF AIDS Foundation.  I believe in the SFAF and the work they do PREVENTING the spread and ASSISTING those living and dying with HIV.  They operate one of the most comprehensive needle exchange programs in the country, helping make the HIV transmission rate from dirty needles ZERO in greater San Francisco.\n\nHIV/AIDS is not a gay disease. \nIt is not a young person's disease. \nIt is not a drug addict's disease.\nIt is not a people of color disease.\nIt is an all-of-us disease.\n\nI train for thousands of miles and spin when I can't train outside. My first full week of June is dedicated to the fight for one simple fact: \n\nHIV IS 100% PREVENTABLE.  THIS PANDEMIC CAN END IN OUR LIFETIME!  YOUR DONATION WILL HELP TREMENDOUSLY!\n\nPlease give what you can.  $1,000, $500, $250, $100, or whatever you can.  Spread your payments over multiple months if you want.  And thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nHelp me support AIDS/LifeCycle by giving what you can. We'll keep riding until AIDS and HIV are a thing of the past.\n\nPlease help by donating at:\nhttp://www.tofighthiv.org/goto/gregjarvis",

If you can't participate you can still make a donation! (links with directions below)\n\nAs you may know, the past few months my mom has undergone treatment for a brain tumor. This is what inspired me to get involved in Brain Tumor awareness, education, and fundraising. You can read more about my experience on my Fundraising Page. \n\nI've never done one of these fundraising things before but this is a cause I believe in with all my heart so I figured I'd give it a shot. If you feel inspired to run with me - great! Donate - great! If you read this message all the way through and just take a moment to lend your thoughts and prayers to the 700,000 people living with brain tumors today - great! \n\nI can't thank my friends and family enough for the love and support I've received from them through the last few months.

Join our debut show at The House of Blues!\n\nFeaturing LIVE performances from:\n\nKing by Friday\n\nKING BY FRIDAY has a simple performance philosophy...perform GREAT music for GREAT people and have a GREAT time doing it. Fans and other musicians have described them as \"a HOT live show,\" \"Spot- on performance,\" and \"Super fun presentation!\" \n\nBased in Libertyville Illinois, they have headlined many of Chicago's top venues including House of Blues, Double Door, Abbey Pub, Bottom Lounge, and Many many more. They have even performed as a featured group on ABC7 news! Their reach has extended to NYC with live performances at National UnderGround.\n\nhttp://www.kingbyfriday.com/\n\nChicago Loud 9\nIn January of 2012, members of three local Chicago bands came together for a Friday night winter showcase at the House of Blues\u2026 \n\nWhat began as a one-night-only musical experiment has become a fully-stacked 9-piece hip-hop / rock / pop ensemble, known for its wild mix of styles and high-intensity, rock-infused performances. Chicago Loud 9 has since appeared at a number of major venues across the city, including Double Door, Hard Rock Cafe, Subterranean, and Beat Kitchen, as well as several stints throughout the Chicago summer street festival circuit, including the Taste of Lincoln Ave in Lincoln Park.\n\n Labeled by reviewers as \u201ca band with no genre,\u201d Chicago Loud 9 blends veteran grunge-funk rockers from Eleven Dollar Life, live horns from roots-reggae outfit Drop Steady, rhythm players from cover bands Dr. Rock / On The Radio, and rapper-MC Pro Blak The Don. \n\nhttp://chicagoloud9.com/\n\nCellrs\nHigh-energy, must-see show that seems to top with each performance, and a sound that can only be described as \"Dirty Blues Pop\".\n\n\"We're a kind of lo-fi, avant-garde blues band that still manages to sneak some soul in here and there. We enjoy playing what we believe to be great songs with positive, high-energy performances while not getting caught up in the studio perfection that so many artists seek these days. We want our songs to maintain a human element to them. We don't want a \"snapped to a grid/copy and paste\" feel when you listen to our music. \n\nSame with our live shows. As Leonard Cohen said, 'There is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.'\" \n\nhttp://cellrs.com/\n\nFletcher\nFletcher began as a basement project between brothers Oscar and Harvey Baker and their long time friend Tom Fry. \n\nWhile two of the members are originally from London, England and the other from Chicago, IL, the band has been able to create a new strand of new-age British Rock with quirky melodies and brain tingling music.\n\n Insisting on sticking to a three-piece band, Fletcher has created a vigorous and chemistry driven connection between each member. After collaborating for just under nine months, Fletcher has gained a reputation around Chicago and beyond.\n\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/Fletchertheband\n\nRed Jr\nFrom the furthest stretches of Chicago come four unique musicians who delve into their listeners minds and bodies to bring them to complete awareness and total ecstasy using their pulsing rhythms and electrifying melodies that takes you to beautiful, far away places.\n\n\"It felt like I had sex for three straight days.\" - anonymous fan on how she felt the day after a Red Jr. concert. It's like that.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/redjrmusic\n\nAyOH\nThink The Killers meets Coldplay meets Imagine Dragons. It's music for the hungry at heart.\n\nAyOH found their rhythm and took it in stride, developing their own unique blend of harmony and sound, churning out original songs and quickly coming into their own.\n\n\nWith such natural chemistry and dozens of original songs on their roster, the next step for AyOH was to head to the studio. Chicago\u2019s own legendary musician and owner of Transient Sound Productions, Steve Gillis, was \u201cblown away\u201d by what he heard from AyOH. \n\nhttp://www.ayoh.bandcamp.com/\n\nAFTER PARTY w/ Vourteque at The Foundation Room 4th Floor of House of Blues. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHouse of Blues Chicago \n329 N Dearborn St \n$10 pre-sale, $12 Door \n17+, Doors open 6:30 pm\n\nGet Tickets Here: http://bit.ly/PnPf9S",

We are honoring our late friend, Kevin Oldham, by raising funds for this organization in his memory. I hope you can help!\n\nThis is a team race that covers around 200 miles from Madison, WI to Chicago, IL.  The race does not stop and goes straight through the night.  Not many events like this!\n\nWe have assembled 12 runners for the 2014 Ragnar Relay - Chicago.  Seven firefighters from Waukegan, one from Grayslake and 4 others are  friends of mine that are killer runners.  We finished 49th, last year out of around 250 teams that finished.  Pretty solid I think!  This event takes place June 6th and 7th and starts in Madison, WI and ends in Chicago, IL..... THAT'S RIGHT! We are going to team up to cover around 200 miles of terrain across two states. Why are we doing this, you ask? Well we are raising money for a GREAT cause, Code 3 For A Cure. Code 3 For A Cure raises funds for firefighters that are battling all forms of cancer. They provide financial assistance and moral support for firefighters going through their darkest hour. Not battling a fire, battling for their life. Three years ago we lost our friend, Kevin Oldham, to pancreatic cancer. He left behind a wife and two precious girls. While Kevin was stricken with his cancer, he toured the country with C3FAC to spread a message of \"early detection\" to his fellow firemen. His goal was simple, to use his story to save another life before it was too late. Kevin was a great man, husband, father, son, brother, friend. We honor his memory by dedicating these 200 miles of ground pounding to him and his cause! Help us carry on Kevin's memory and mission of helping other firefighters with cancer!

Als DJ und Produzent seit den fr\u00fchen Neunziger, z\u00e4hlt er wohl mit zu einem der ganz gro\u00dfen in diesem Genre. Als junger Produzent unter der Flagge des ber\u00fchmten Labels Djax up Beats, welches heuer das 25 Jahre Jubil\u00e4um feiert, trug Mike Dearborn ma\u00dfgeblich mit zu dessen Erfolg bei. Er schaffte es sogar auf dem Album \u201eHomeworks\u201c von \u201eDaft Punk\u201c namentlich als Inspiration erw\u00e4hnt zu werden. Den weltweit gebuchten DJ-Namen Mike Dearborn kennt man in Europa von gro\u00dfen intern. Festivals und Raves wie z.B. Mayday und Awakenings. Unser Motto von \"Mit Techno alt werden- Feiern wie fr\u00fcher\" wird seinem Titel gerecht, wenn sein 120 Minuten Oldschhool-Set den Cembrankeller in einen Dampfkessel verwandelt und f\u00fcr eine unvergessliche Nacht sorgen wird. Support bekommt Mike Dearborn von Martin Mueller, dem Linzer Labelbesitzer von \u201eHOME Recordings, welcher mit seinem Label seit 2006 konsiquent seinen Weg verfolgt und daf\u00fcr mit internationaler Aufmerksamkeit belohnt wurde. So hat ihn Dave Clarke auf der Playlist und der bekannte DJ und Producer Mark EG, Redakteur beim Tilllate Magazine vergleicht ihn mit einen Global Player wie Robert Hood.  Chicago- Legende Mike Dearborn ist auf der 2011 erschienenen 12 Vinyl von Martin Muellers HOME Recordings namens \u201eAsso\u201c mit einem Remix vertreten.\n\nWeiters supporten Mike Dearborn die beiden bekannten Oldschool-Veteranen und DJ\u2018s Burne Maximilian und Dean Lee.

        "description": "Alicia Pons and Luis Rojas will be returning to Chicago following the Chicago Mini Tango Festival.  They will be giving an intensive weekend of tango workshops on May 3 and 4, 2014. We will be structuring the classes for the intermediate and advanced dancer. They will both be available for privates during their stay. Please schedule the privates early. \n\nBio\nAlicia Pons is an elegant and accomplished dancer with a refined technique and distinctive personality. Her ability to imbue the role of the woman with verve and style has made her one of the most sought after female partners in Buenos Aires milongas.\n\nShe is most noted for her beautiful foot play and the strongly sensual connection with her partner, which is done with humor and decorum. She exemplifies communication and presence in the dance, and this is a focus in her teaching for both men and women.\n\nAlicia was trained in classical ballet from an early age and as a young woman performed in some of Buenos Aires' most famous theaters such as the Colon, the Coliseo, and the Alvear. Her introduction to tango came later, and her first teacher was Graciela Gonzalez, whose women's technique helped shape Alicia's tango footwork. Alicia then gravitated toward the milonguero style and her first inspiration and male teacher in that style was Tete Rusconi, one of the most renowned milongueros of his generation.\n\nShe taught a number of years with Cacho Dante, with whom she has performed at the Teatro San Martin as part of the City of Buenos Aires Tango Festival. Alicia has been teaching both private and group classes on her own in Buenos Aires and the U.S. for the last few years. She has become a very popular visiting instructor on the U.S. Argentine Tango workshop circuit.\n\nAs a teacher, Alicia emphasizes the connection between the partners, and in particular the woman's ability to not just follow, but to be an equal protagonist in the dance. Her knowledge of the mechanics of what makes the dance work in the \"milonguero\" embrace is unique.\n\nAlicia's teaching methods are grounded in her academic training. She holds a degree in Educational Science and Psychology, and she is currently an instructor for university level education students, in addition to her teaching, being a mother of two sons, and running her family real estate business. She is a very warm and caring person who loves to share her knowledge.\n\nLuis Rojas is a Professor and Dancer of Argentine Tango since 2004. He gave regular classes in Mar Del Plata, Argentina every Tuesday and Thursday from 2004 to 2008. He also organized during that time a Milonga every Saturday called \u201cMilonga La Academia.\u201d In 2009, he moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, giving private classes and group classes in the hall of \u201cEstudios A\u201d.\n\nAlso in 2009, he travelled for the first time to Europe for 80 days primarily to Vienna, Austria. He gave group and private classes and performed exhibitions of Argentine Tango in events sponsored by the Argentine Consulate. He returned to Buenos Aires in December 2009 and continued giving group and private classes.\n\nIn March 2010, he returned to Europe for 85 days. He went to Vienna, Austria and to various locations in Italy. He gave group and private classes and exhibitions. Afterwards he returned to Buenos Aires and he started giving group classes and private classes and organized the Milonga in the \u201cNacional Dance Hall\u201d, Alicina 1465, Buenos Aires. He later returned to Europe in 2011 and returned to Buenos Aires in December.\n\nHe returned to Europe in February 2011. This time, however, he taught and performed Argentine Tango in Italy, France, Belgium, Netherlands and Spain. He also returned to Europe from October to December 2011. The rest of the time in 2011, while he was in Buenos Aires he taught classes in the \u201cNational Dance Hall.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, he continued with his group and private classes and exhibitions in Buenos Aires. He returned to Europe in March 2012 for 3 months from March to June. He then returned to Buenos Aires where he continued giving his classes in the \u201cNational Dance Hall\u201d on Fridays. Later in 2012, he started giving classes with the great Alicia Pons in the dance hall \u201cAires Tangueros\u201d until early January 2013 when he left to give classes and perform in Italy, Belgium, Holland and Spain.\n \nHere are links to performances by Alicia Pons and Luis Rojas: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3wHHU18XO0\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF0BaxaJR7Y\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1I3ZkEhNH8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwL5Ttj1q58\n\nFor more information regarding Alicia Pons, please go \nto:http://www.aliciapons.com.ar/home-ingles.htm\n\nFriday pre-milonga class followed by a special Milonga Rubia (9:30 pm \u2013 2:30 am)\n8:00-9:15 pm   Special pre-milonga class  \"Milonguero Techniques for Leaders and Followers\u201d \nthis class is FREE to purchasers of a full weekend workshop package; $25 if purchased separately\n\nSATURDAY, MAY 3 \u2013 at American Tango Institute (325 N Hoyne, C-404, Chicago)\nA: Tango  \u2013   12:00-1:20 pm  Dynamics and Fluidity in D\u2019Arienzo and Biaggi. \nB: Milonga \u2013  1:40-3:00 pm Runs in different directions; Giros in Double Time.  \nC:  Vals \u2013  3:20-4:40 pm Interpretation: Dissociation of the body; breathing, and how to lead.\nSUNDAY, MAY 4 \u2013 at American Tango Institute (325 N Hoyne, C-404, Chicago)\nD: Tango \u2013    12:00-1:20 pm Tango Milonguero.

Formed in Israel in 2007 by guitarist Dani Rabin and saxophonist Danny Markovitch (who then relocated to Chicago in 2009) from the very start, Marbin has possessed an energy and zeal perhaps only surpassed by their work ethic, dedication and habit for not sitting still for long. \nMarbin is making their presence felt and placing their indelible stamp on progressive music.

        "description": "What is Blacklight Run\u2122?\n\nBlacklight Run\u2122 is a unique experience focused less on speed and more on Glow in the dark fun with friends and family. Glowing runners come from all different ages, shapes, sizes, and speeds; but everyone who shows up to get Glowed\u2122 has the time of their life. Whether you are an avid runner or a walk around the park walker, the 3 miles of the Blacklight Run\u2122 course will have you glowing and waiting for the next one!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Blacklight Run\u2122 has been setup with very simple rules:\n\n1) White shirts (any white T-shirt will work) worn at the start line.\n\n2) Glow covered runners at the Finish! Runner/walkers begin the 5k at the start line like a brand new canvas.\n\nBy the end, they look like they fell into a ghost busters movie and are covered with different colored Glow\u2122. This is the first of its kind at night and is quickly sweeping the nation!\n\nEach person running will receive:\n\n- Blacklight Run T-Shirt\n- Special Offers from Sponsors\n- Race Bib\n- Glow Pack to throw at the finish line!\n\nWhat is the Glow?\n\nAlong the running path you will find Glow Zone's, which are associated with a designated color: green, pink, or blue. As the runners/walkers reach the Glow Zones they are showered with neon powder that glows under our high beam black lights. All products are 100% natural and non-toxic. At the end of the race there will be a Blacklight Run\u2122 Party filled with Music pumping from the DJ, Glowing Neon Powder and tons of black lights!\n\n\nWhat about the finish line?\n\nAre you ready for the best After Race party on the PLANET. After the finish, participants are encouraged to stick around, celebrate, and see exactly how much Glow one person can handle. We will have Glow, and festivities that will make your Glowing head spin.\n\nStay Tuned\n\nFor the latest race updates and runner giveaways stay tuned to this web page, or follow Blacklight Run\u2122 Facebook or Twitter pages.",

From lightning fast picking, to sentimental ballads\u2014playing storied original material, traditional songs, and contemporary covers \u2014 the PROWLERS\u2019 live show leaves no one wanting.\nThe band was recently selected to spend a month in West Africa and headed back to Europe in 2014 for their largest tour abroad to date. The Prowlers continue to push the envelope with their highly original songwriting, tight arrangements, and electrifying stage presence. With the bluegrass mantle on their back and the best fans in the world by their side, The Henhouse Prowlers are here to stay for a long, long time.\n\nhttp://henhouseprowlers.com\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/henhouseprowlers\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xl2zNq3Pksk\n\n=======================\nThe Black Elephant Band (F\u00fcrth)\n=======================\nEin kongenialer Opener ist The Black Elephant Band alias Jan Bratenstein. Das Intro sagt: \u201e... beinahe Antifolk. Zumindest geht er seine Songs \u00e4hnlich sorglos und humorvoll an wie beispielsweise Kimya Dawson. Und es reicht ihm seine Akustikgitarre, um die kleinen lakonischen Perlen zu instrumentieren. Eine Art Jonathan Richman aus dem tiefen S\u00fcdosten der Republik, absolut unterhaltsam.\u201c\nUnd endlich mal wieder im tiefen S\u00fcdosten der Republik zu h\u00f6ren!\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Black-Elephant-Band/216156318401431\nhttp://soundcloud.com/the-black-elephant-band\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35_60WIdQAo",

        "description": "Hi Everybody! \n\nI just signed up for the Bank of America Chicago Marathon! ...and you know what that means! It's time to RUN, RUN, & RUN! I know I've done it before, but this time it's a little different after I hurt my knee. Training is going to be a lot slower and I'm not going to be able to train as much or as hard as I did last summer. So, that being said... Every Marathon is a new experience, so let's make this one to remember and one that can really make a difference!\n\nThis year, I really want to run for a good cause and FOR A PURPOSE! ...and so, I will be running in order to raise money for the Organization called RISE INTERNATIONAL. What is it you might ask?! RISE is an Org. that builds primary schools in rural Angola to educate children, empower communities and contribute to the rebuilding of the country.This cause really speaks to me because all my life I have been given the privilege to go to elementary, middle school, high school, and even college! And honestly, I haven't been taking the full advantage of it. I've actually been very ungrateful about the life I have been given, forgetting that not everyone CAN or is ABLE to do what I do everyday. Sometimes all I want to do is dropout, give up, and just do something else with my life. I know that school isn't for everyone, but I still don't think that it's fair to those who have never experienced it. And so, here's were you come in! In order for these kids to go to school and better themselves, RISE needs help raising money to build schools for them to actually go to! Every child should have the chance to go to school, to learn to read and write. 4 million children in Angola do not have any access to primary education. I feel that everyone should be given the chance and the choice to go to school. So, can we help these kids to reach their full potential and even help them stop the cycle of poverty and illiteracy?\n\nIf this cause speaks to you as it has for me, feel welcomed to donate to this page. Again, my goal will be $1000, where just $250 can send a child to school! \n \nFOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LIKE TO RUN:\nAs I start training for this marathon, I will be still continuing on with my running club, NICE GUYS! For those who are interested in running a half marathon, a 5K, a 15K, want to build your endurance, or just want to run... You may contact me at jessal100103@gmail.com, Facebook message me, or text me if you would like me to train you or run with you. Each one-on-one or group run will be $1. And I promise you, each run & $1 we raise, will be time well spent. It will be worth that every mile and every minute knowing it may someday give a child the chance to better themselves in some way. So, again I never like asking for money! But, if you are willing and want to help... feel free to donate to this awesome cause!\n\nOtherwise, thank you all for your support as always :)\n\nFor more information on RISE INTERNATIONAL please visit the link below.\n\nhttp://riseinternational.org/",

EVERYONE IS ENCOURAGED TO STAY AND HELP CLEAN UP IF NECESSARY!\n\nInternational Pillow Fight Day is a global celebration of the ancient art of pillow fighting. Throughout history, pillow fighting has been the civilized form of battle which results in victory for all who take part. Come, raise your trustiest war-pillow to remind destructive forces everywhere that the only truly valiant fights are won with stuffing and cloth!\n\nWe also want this event to be safe and respectful to the community that hosts it, so please read and follow the guidelines on the opposite side of the flyer. We're here to have fun and make people smile, and maybe even to make some people realize that life isn't all work and no play; but there will always be those for whom such pastimes are \"childish\" or \"inappropriate\". These people can't be saved, so just let them be. Additionally, this is a family friendly and community friendly event, so please don't engage in any illegal or reckless behaviors. Pillow fighting can be a blast without anybody needing to take a ride downtown. Let's make sure the only people getting smacked are those who want to be!\n\nA word about feathers- I know some pillow fighters really enjoy the flying feathers, but the simple truth is that a huge blizzard of down floating around the streets, parks, and into the river is a nightmare to clean up, not just for us, but for the dedicated city sanitation employees who are probably underpaid and overworked. Beyond that, it's not kind to the environment, or to our fellow citizens. So, like the owl says, \"Give a Hoot, Don't Pollute!\"\n\nTrash bags and gloves will be provided for those who want to help clean up after the event. Heck, you can even clean up the regular litter if you want- no reason we can't give back a little, right? When clean up is done, please join us for post-battle refreshments and tales of heroic deeds at a local eatery!\n\nThere are cities all around the world, from Amsterdam to Zurich, participating in Pillow Fight Day, and you can see all the cool places joining the battle at pillowfightday.com\n\nLet's make sure Chicago remains one of the most memorable, fantastic, fun, and safe cities to pillow fight in, and let's show those other cities that we can pummel with the best of 'em!\n________________________________________",

        "description": "RE:VISION - Chicago May 2nd \nfeaturing Alex Grey & Allyson Grey\nPresented By In The Loop Productions, \nEuphonic Conceptions, Silver Wrapper, and Stilldream\nmusic from: \n\nMichal Menert (Pretty Lights Music)\n\nThe first artist signed to Pretty Lights Music, after co-producing Pretty Lights' debut album, \"Taking Up Your Precious Time (2006)\" and contributing to a handful of the project's tracks afterward.  In 2010 he released his first full-length solo album, entitled \"Dreaming Of A Bigger Life.\" He also performs with Paul Basic under the name Half Color. Michal's second release, the mega-LP \"Even If It Isn't Right\" is dropping in spring of 2012. Half Color's debut EP is expected soon after.. \n\nPhutureprimitive\n\nPhutureprimitive's music is best described as dripping wet love drops of nasty mind melting sonic bliss. Lush melodies drift across intricate rhythms, groove heavy beats and warm, fuzzy bass lines. Often exploring a dark and dense palette, there is also a profound sense of tranquility and beauty, engaging the listener in hypnotic movement and often escalating into a full-on kinetic experience. Shimmering with cinematic qualities, his music ultimately speaks to the body, mind and soul.\n\nESKMO\n\nBrendan Angelides is a Los Angeles-based electronic music producer who records and performs live as Eskmo. His multi-genre compositions have been featured on influential labels like Ninja Tune, Warp Records and Planet Mu. The \"Terra\" EP is the follow up and opposite-side-of-the-coin release to his October release \"Language\". While \"Language\" delved into \"chunky dance aesthetics turned on their head\", \"Terra\" explores a slower, slightly darker and more raw side of the field. The themes center around Earth from the standpoint of being human and the archetypal worlds we fall into. \n\n\nPaul Basic (Pretty Lights Music)\n\nStarting out as a drummer, Colorado producer Paul Brandt aka Paul Basic joined a band with Derek Vincent Smith (Pretty Lights) and Michal Menert in high school before they each moved on to pursue solo production work. In fall 2011 Paul released his debut EP 'The Mirror' on Pretty Lights Music which featured a gritty, nostalgic sound blending dusty samples, grainy synths, biting bass and thick drums - a combination that earned him an integral place within the PLM movement. \n\n\nLate Night Radio (Denver, CO)\n\nMedellin\u2019s background in hip-hop is crucial to his development as a producer. Unlike some of his contemporaries who came up in the dance music scene, Late Night Radio keeps his cuts funky and inventive with an unshakable commitment to soulful grooves. Even when LNR breaks into high-energy, cabinet-rattling climaxes, the emotional depth remains.

The 15-date summer tour, presented by Live Nation, will take the bands through major metropolitan areas across the United States including New York City, Boston, Dallas, Phoenix, Detroit and more with even more dates to be announced soon.  Tickets for the general public go on sale on starting Friday, January 17 through the Live Nation mobile app and at www.livenation.com.  \n\nCiti\u00ae cardmembers will have access to presale tickets beginning Wednesday, January 15 at 10:00 AM local time through Citi's Private Pass\u00ae Program.  For complete presale details, visit www.citiprivatepass.com.  Live Nation mobile app users (available for both iOS and Android) will have access to presale tickets beginning Thursday, January 16 at 10:00 AM local time.  Band fan club presales will begin on January 14 at 10:00 AM local time.  All presales end at 10:00 PM local time on Thursday, January 16.  \n\n\"It's ironic, that these two legendary bands, who both have roots in Illinois, were label-mates (Columbia/Epic) in the 70's, and experienced waves of immense success in the 80's and 90's, and have somehow continued to consistently make compelling music, both in-studio and on tour.... have never before performed together!\" says Chicago's Robert Lamm.  \"This situation is about to change, as Chicago and REO will perform together during the concert's encore and present a finale that will thrill their audiences. As a musician who has always respected REO's skills, I look forward to our first rehearsals early this summer.  This will be fun!\"\n\n\"With so many personal connections between various members of REO and Chicago, it is amazing that we have never actually toured together. I love it that the Chicago guys feel the way we do about truly playing together when you tour together,\" says REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin.  \"Can you imagine the Chicago horn section on 'Roll With the Changes'? That would blow my mind! This tour promises to deliver some unique music from two bands who have made a ton of hit records, share that Midwest work ethic, and still refuse to sit back on their past accomplishments. We both keep raising the bar, challenging ourselves, and rocking hard... and the audience is the ultimate winner. We are psyched... I can't wait for this tour.\"\n\nAll dates below subject to change.

Glowing runners come from all different ages, shapes, sizes, and speeds. Whether you are a long term runner or a walk around the park stroller, the 3 miles of the Foam Glow 5K\u2122 course will have you shining bright and waiting for the next run.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Foam Glow 5K\u2122 has been setup with very simple rules:\n\n1) White shirt (any white T-shirt will work) worn at the start line. The more white you wear the better.\n\n2) Foam Glow 5K\u2122 runners sprinting through Foam Glow\u2122 Zones to the finish line!\n\nRunner/walkers begin the 5k at the start line like a brand new canvas. By the end, they look like they fell into a tie-dye machine and are covered with different colored foam that glows under black lights.\n\nWhat is the Foam Glow\u2122?\n\nAlong the running path you will find Foam Glow\u2122 Zone's, which are associated with a designated color: Orange, Pink, or Green. As the runners/walkers reach the Foam Glow\u2122 Zones, They they will run through different color foam that Glows in the Dark under our high intensity black lights. All products are 100% natural and non-toxic. At the end of the race there will be a Foam Glow 5K\u2122 after party filled with music pumping from the stage, Foam Glow\u2122 and tons of black lights!\n\nEvery Registered Runner gets:\n\n- Foam Glow 5K\u2122 Event T-Shirt\n- Get blasted by foam at our Glow Zones\n- Sponsor Goodies\n- The best night of their life\n\n\nWhat about the finish line?\n\nAre you ready for the best After Race Party in the world? After the finish, participants are encouraged to stick around, celebrate, and see exactly how much fun one person can handle. In most locations we will have food, Foam Glow\u2122, and festivities that will make your Foam Glowed head spin.\n\nDon't forget to get the latest updates on our facebook page!",

        "description": "DJ Sneak (Magnetic, X-Mix Productions, Chicago)\nHector (Desolat)\nAlci (Robsoul, InFuse)\n\t\t\n\t\nEs gab mal eine Zeit, da war das Backsteingem\u00e4uer an der Geroldstrasse bereits umtriebig, da herrschte in Z\u00fcrich eine Feiertags-Unsitte namens Tanzverbot; keine Part und auch keine Partystimmung an hohen Feiertagen. Gottseidank liegen diese d\u00fcsteren Zeiten l\u00e4ngst hinter der ortsans\u00e4ssigen Clubberschaft. Auch dies ist ein Grund, wieso man das heiligste aller christlichen Feste mit einer ordentlichen Party begehen sollte und eine ordentliche Party wird das hier unter Garantie. Sneak: Mit weit mehr als 600 Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen und einer mehr als 20 Jahre andauernden weltweiten T\u00e4tigkeit ist er einer der wichtigsten Missionare der reinen Houselehre auf dem Planeten. Der aus Puerto Rico stammende Soundfanatiker hat bereits 1992 damit begonnen eigene Tracks zu produzieren, Daft Punk, Armand van Helden und Basement Jaxx nennen ihn als einen ihrer wichtigsten Einflussnehmer und seine Auszeichnungen, darunter auch diverse als \u201edj of the year\u201c f\u00fcllen ganze Troph\u00e4enschr\u00e4nke. Obschon er bereits Mitte der 90er der absoluten Oberliga des House angeh\u00f6rte, wird sein Name auch heute noch (sehr) oft genannt, wenn es um eine Aufz\u00e4hlung \u201eder Gr\u00f6ssten\u201c geht. Hector: Der urspr\u00fcnglich aus Guadalajara (MEX) stammende Hector hat sich erst in seiner Heimat, und zwar an den Decks der legend\u00e4ren Bar Americas, einen Namen gemacht. Dann setzte er \u00fcber den Atlantik und nahm die englische Szene im Handstreich und hat sich in London h\u00e4uslich eingerichtet. Noch immer bespielt er da die Top-Dancefloors und verl\u00e4sst die Themsestadt nur im Winter, um Sets in den namhaftesten Clubs auf Ibiza zu spielen. Wobei... stimmt nicht ganz: Auch in der Schweiz ist der Desolat-Exponent ein gern und oft gesehener Gast. Abgerundet wird die Nacht vom Vorortspieler mit ausl\u00e4ndischem Spitzen-Palmares Alci, der sich, respektive seine Releases und auch Sets, mit den Namen der grossen Hausnummern Robsoul und InFuse London schm\u00fccken darf. \n\nEiersuchen auf laut und lustig. Gibt\u2019s nur im Supermarket.",

Soily caves and swollen echoes. Shrill metallics and warbling unease. Improv stalwarts Colin Fisher and Brandon Valdivia coalesce to engineer sonic liquid earthquakes and zen aural explosions. (Members of Mas Aya, Pachamama, Colin Fisher.)\n\nKING WEATHER\nhttp://mechanicalforestsound.blogspot.ca/2013/07/recording-king-weather.html\nSteve Ward prays to the shrine of trombone drone. D. Alex Meeks shovels out the disheveled drum crackle of KC Accidental. They meet on a holy plain, unseen but heard. Pulsing distant glory like a spirit army marching to the beckon of trumpet bearing angels.

        "description": "The  Operature is a live performance and augmented reality (AR) poem engaging themes of anatomical science and spectacle. The work\u2019s choreography and use of technology are influenced by research into a series of diverse anatomical histories including early-modern surgical theatres, Francis Glessner Lee's miniature crime scene re-enactments known as the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, and The Stud File, an autobiographical record of the sexual exploits of Samuel Steward, a 20th century tattoo artist, gay pornographer, and friend of Gertrude Stein.\n\n The performance is extended by a 25 screen interactive exhibition on the ground floor based on the concept of an operating theatre. The Operature includes an interactive operating table that controls screen-based content and distributes virtual AR overlays that can be viewed through mobile devices. A smart-phone is not required as the work's elaborate set includes a series of viewing stations. \n\n ATOM-R is a provisional collective exploring forensics, anatomy, and 21st century embodiment through performance, language and emerging technologies. Participants include Mark Jeffery (choreography), Judd Morrissey (technology and dramaturgical systems), Justin Deschamps, Sam Hertz, Christopher Knowlton, and Blake Russell,(collaborators/performers) with Meghan Moe Beitiks (Technical Director), Andrew Pace (Textile Artist), Laura Prieto-Velasco (Prop / Jeweller)  Alfredo Salazar - Caro (New Media Artist), Bryan Saner (Master Carpenter), Kate Hampel (Costumes), Company Manager Stephanie Acosta and Studio Assistant Alexandria Eregbu.\n\nATOM-R co-founders Judd Morrissey and Mark Jeffery are a collaboration merging digital literary practices and performance (2003 - ). A given piece may have no singular fixed form is alternately or simultaneously presented as internet art, durational live installation or a performance of fixed length. Both artists were members of Goat Island Performance Group.\n\nThe work is partially supported by a grant from the Chicago Dancemakers Forum and commissioning support from the European research group ELMCIP (Electronic Literature as a Model for Creativity and Innovation in Practice) in collaboration with Edinburgh College of Art and New Media Scotland. The piece has also been supported by The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and by artist's workshops at Dance4, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, York St John University and the Department of English at King\u2019s College London and supported by the Innovation programme at the Cultural Institute at King\u2019s College London. The work is also supported by the National Museum of Health and Medicine Chicago with the collective being artists in residence at the Museum. \n\n \n\nPLEASE NOTE ALL TICKET SALES GO TO ATOM-R's LINKS HALL FISCAL ACCOUNT.

The first one will depart that location at 12:00 PM. The second will depart at 3:00 PM. If you would rather stay at Federal Plaza than march with us, fliers will be provided for you to pass out if you have not brought your own.\n\nPeople with opinions across the political spectrum are invited to unite and find common ground against corruption. We will overcome the petty divide created by more or less meaningless party lines and conquer propaganda by forming communities of support and compassion. Together we will begin a sustained fight for freedom and begin engaging in a relentless campaign of nonviolent civil disobedience. People will pledge to take part in whatever tactics they are interested in throughout a sustained three-month cycle. Here are some examples of these tactics:\n\n\t>Mass gatherings, demonstrations;\n\t>Marches, Parades;\n\t>Flash mobs, swarms;\n\t>Worker Strikes;\n\t>Hunger Strikes;\n\t>Sit-ins;\n\nA more complete list of tactics is available on the description of the worldwide event: https://waveofaction.org/job/worldwide-wave-launch-gatherings/\n\nWe MUST come together and unite if we hope to enact any real change. You know what you can do to help make this happen, DO IT!! If we can all come together as a species and act as one I have no doubt this movement will succeed.",

This music was born from Jews exiled from Spain and Portugal, traveling through the former Ottoman lands: Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Morocco. As such, the group brings together instruments and traditions from the wide span of cultures that fed into this musical language historically, updating it with their own youthful energy and contemporary backgrounds in jazz improvisation and electronica.

        "description": "JUMP UP RECORDS continues its 20th Anniversary celebration in 2014 curating JAMAICAN OLDIES PRODUCTIONS, a partnership with MAYNE STAGE that brings vintage Jamaican ska and reggae vocalists to Chicago. We are very proud to announce our very first \u201cdeejay\u201d show featuring the original Kingston hitmaker DENNIS ALCAPONE, performing for the first time ever in Chicago! \n\nThe art of talk-over on record has been evident throughout the history of Afro-American and Afro-Caribbean sounds; its origins can be directly traced back to the rhythmic vocal rhyming of Jamaican deejay toasting developed in the 60\u2019s and early 70\u2019s. American hip hop owes much of its style to 70\u2019s pioneer DJ Kool Herc who was a Jamaican expatriate, while dancehall mega stars Shabba Ranks, Shaggy, Lady Saw, Sean Paul and Damian Marley have all achieved pop chart busters with toasting-influenced vocals. Jamaican deejay toasting has also influenced various styles of modern dance music, most notably jungle, drum & bass, reggaeton, UK garage, and dubstep.\n\nIt all began in the 60\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s when Jamaican \u201cdeejays\u201d fist laid claim to being recording artistes in their own right. The first pioneering toasters were Sir Lord Comic, Count Matchuki, and King Stitt, but it was not until U Roy began toasting over specially mixed Duke Reid dubplates at  King Tubby\u2019s sound system that the style first really caught the imagination of the Jamaican public. The enormous success of these sides sparked a frenzy among producers, and of the deejays who burst forth on the scene none proved more popular than DENNIS ALCAPONE.\n\nAside from his choice of superb original songs over which to record, DENNIS ALCAPONE\u2019s popularity was primarily due to his unique, deceptively relaxed style. His command of classic rhythms, seamless interplay of deejay and original lyric, plus his trademark vocal effects produced music that has stood the test of time. ALCAPONE had his own distinct half-sung style with high-pitched whoops, with his influence clearly visible in DJ's that followed including I-Roy, Dillinger, Michigan & Smiley, and the later \"sing-jays\" such as  Eek-A-Mouse and Pinchers. \n\nDENNIS ALCAPONE\u2019s singing style was pioneered at his own \"EL PASO\" sound system in 1969 and on his earliest recordings for  KEITH HUDSON, COXSONE DODD / STUDIO ONE, and WINSTON \u201cNINEY\u201d HOLNESS, all of whom produced the singer in 1970. In the period from 1970 to 1973, ALCAPONE was prolific: he cut over 100 singles and released three albums, recording for BUNNY LEE, PRINCE BUSTER, SONIA POTTINGER, LEE PERRY, JOE GIBBS, and DUKE REID. The latter, who had issued U Roy's earliest hits, repeated his success with ALCAPONE on \"Number One Station\", \"Rock To The Beat\", \"Wake Up Jamaica\", and \"Teach the Children\". ALCAPONE also had hits Bunny Lee including \"Ripe Cherry\" and \"Guns Don't Argue\". In 1972 he was named the island's most popular deejay by Swing magazine, and shortly after he embarked on a successful tour of the UK. Dennis eventually relocated to London in 1974, and although his output dropped off considerably, he still occasionally gave glimpses of his undeniable talent, with recordings for a number of UK based producers including Sidney Crooks and Count Shelley. \n\nHe returned to live performance and recording in the 1988 and appeared at the WOMAD festival in 1989. He returned to Jamaica in 1990 to record again with Bunny Lee, and also made an appearance on Adrian Sherwood\u2019s  \u201cTwo Bad Card\u201d album. He released an album with Mad Professor in 1997 entitled \u201c21st Century Version\u201d. With the 2000\u2019s came a massive reissue campaign for his catalog,  including TROJAN RECORD\u2019s \u201cMy Voice Is Insured For Half A Million Dollars\u201d, \u201cGuns Don\u2019t Argue \u2013 The Anthology 1970-1977\u201d, \u201cSoul To Soul \u2013 DJs Choice\u201d and most recently Kingston Sounds\u2019 \u201cYeah Yeah Yeah Mah Up The Dance\u201d. \n\nDENNIS ALCAPONE will be backed by an all star band lead by THE DRASTICS, who will also perform a full set of their reggae dub roots originals.\n\nTHE DRASTICS with MC ZULU\n\nThe Drastics are modern roots music. Their sound fits as easily in a Kingston dancehall as it does in an artist's loft-party in the warehouse district. Though primarily classified as a reggae group, The Drastics embrace many styles of music both live and in the studio. This can be heard in their songs which draw from roots Jamaican music, hip hop, hard-bop jazz, afro-beat, dancehall, as well as folk music from Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. Take this powder keg cocktail of styles, add the pulse of gritty everyday urban living and you get one explosive sound. Not playing into any gimmicks or compromising to trends (\"The Drastics deserve much credit for moving deep into unchartered territories\" - allMusic Guide) The Drastics have been consistantly rocking crowds for three years from NYC to LA and everywhere in between (\"dub masters, The Drastics ... never fail to put on a killer party\" - TimeOut Chicago).  https://soundcloud.com/thedrastics\n\nAKASHA\n\nChicago\u2019s AKASKA deliver rich reggae grooves with sweet vocal harmonies. Stylistically, AKASHA sounds like they stepped out of a 1972 session at STUDIO ONE, it\u2019s powerfully authentic yet accessible to the contemporary ear. AKASHA\u2019s distinct approach is refreshing and earnest, courageously trailblazing a path for a new generation to receive the gifts of the Jamaican musical canon. The AKASKA sound gives birth to an unmistakable variety of heavy, raw grooves reminiscent of The Skatalites, The Maytals, Desmond Dekker and The Wailers. Hosts of the monthly SIMMER DOWN night, AKASHA are true die-hards keeping authentic roots culture alive and well in the Windy City.  https://soundcloud.com/akashaband\n\nDJ Chuck Wren, Darren Reggae, and Feel The Rhythm DJs spin your favorite Jamaican oldies - strictly on vinyl - throughout the night and afterward until 3 am in the Act One Pub.  \n\nAll this PLUS vendors selling original Jamaican vinyl, hand screened concert posters, JUMP UP RECORDS' massive mail order table and much more. 18+ show.\n\nTICKET INFO: \nTickets ON SALE NOW via Manye Stage website www.maynestage.com\n \nTickets are $30. \n\nLodging, etc.\n\nMayne Stage is located in Rogers Park, north of Downtown Chicago.

Everything is released online for free at http://chicagosinglesclub.com/. We strive to bring the best Chicago independent bands to new, larger audiences, and to document the state of our city\u2019s music scene through our work.\n\nOshwa is an ordinary experimental rock band who traveled back in time from a not-too-distant, possibly utopian future to play music for those of us stuck here in the present. I think. At least, that\u2019s the best explanation I can come up with for how they can make music that deftly walks the line between comfortingly familiar and wildly bizarrely inventive.\nhttp://chicagosinglesclub.com/singles/9\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Oshwa/156329917748264\nhttp://oshwa.bandcamp.com/\n\n\nWith her virtuosic, soul-inspired vocals and the layered instrumentals emanating from her Wurlitzer and drum machine, Rachel Sarah Thomas of KSRA writes songs that burst with intensity. In performance, she stands behind an array of technology, building textures through looping pedals and delays. Despite the modernity of her setup, there\nis an undeniable classic pop quality to\nher songwriting.\nhttp://chicagosinglesclub.com/singles/1\nhttps://www.facebook.com/KSRAMUSIC\nhttp://kserra.bandcamp.com/\n\nEvery member of Jaime Rojo shares two very different qualities: a masterful command over their instrument, and the restraint to keep their playing powerfully minimalist. These songs merit multiple listens to appreciate the sheer density of interesting rhythms, riffs, and flourishes scattered throughout the tracks.\nhttp://chicagosinglesclub.com/singles/8\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jaimerojochicago\nhttp://jaimerojo.bandcamp.com/\n\n21+\nDoors at 8:00 PM\nMusic at 9:00 PM\nThe Empty Bottle\n1035 N Western\nFREE",

Having been a mainstay of the Northeast \u201cjam circuit\u201d for years, Jimkata\u2019s refined \u201celectro rock\u201d sound \u2013 one of a band that has found it\u2019s voice after years of experimentation \u2013 is in many ways more \u201cindie rock\u201d than jam, more 90\u2032s dance than EDM, more lyrical than instrumental, yet the band manages to keep the jam, EDM and technically advanced instrumental elements intact as it carves out a new path for themselves and many of their peers who were inspired by Die Digital. Jimkata\u2019s relevant, quotable lyrics create moods not just for the fleeting moments, but for the lifestyle of an entire generation, and the sum of the music and songwriting appeals to fans of artists like MGMT, LCD Soundsystem, Talking Heads and the best of the \u201990\u2032s pop-rock world. A staple of the festival circuit from the Rockies to the Atlantic, Jimkata\u2019s 2013 festival schedule included heavy hitters like Summer Camp (Chillicothe, IL), Gathering of The Vibes (Bridgeport, CT), Catskill Chill (Hancock, NY), Rootwire (Logan, OH) among many others.\n\nChicago Funk Mafia \nThe derivation of the term Mafia is nebulous, but thought to originate from the arabic slang term \"mahyas\"-which means aggressive, proud, or boastful.",

        "description": "Shows at 7PM & 10PM\n\n\u201cThe Bladerunner Project, a John Zorn outfit including the godlike talents of Zorn on his signature instrument, prolific modern musician and bassist Bill Laswell, and heavy metal drumming powerhouse Dave Lombardo (Slayer, Fant\u00f4mas, etc.) will deliver an electrifying performance at Reggie\u2019s for Bladerunner\u2019s United States premiere as well as their ONLY midwestern date on Saturday, May 3nd, 2014. The Chicago date will only be preceded by a Bladerunner performance at the Adelaide Festival in Australia in March of 2014. The music created by these gentlemen is something to experience first hand. It\u2019s not jazz, it\u2019s not rock, it\u2019s not funk, but all of these combined.\u201d\n\nBLADERUNNER (featuring Zorn / Laswell / Lombardo)\t\n\n\u201cJohn Zorn is an American avant-garde composer, arranger, producer, saxaphonist and multi-instrumentalist with hundreds of album credits as performer, composer and producer across a variety of genres including jazz, rock, hardcore, classical, surf, metal, klezmer, soundtrack, ambient and improvised music. Zorn has stated \u201cAll the various styles are organically connected to one another. I\u2019m an additive person \u2013 the entire storehouse of my knowledge informs everything I do.\u201d For Zorn \u201cComposing is more than just imagining music\u2014it\u2019s knowing how to communicate it to musicians. And you don\u2019t give an improviser music that\u2019s completely written out, or ask a classical musician to improvise. I\u2019m interested in speaking to musicians in their own languages, on their own terms, and in bringing out the best in what they do. To challenge them and excite them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBill Laswell ranks among the most prolific of modern musicians, being involved in hundreds of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. Laswell\u2019s music draws upon many different genres, most notably funk, various world music, jazz, dub and ambient styles. He has also played or produced music from the noisier, more aggressive end of the rock spectrum, such as hardcore punk and metal. Some of the acts Laswell has worked with include Method of Defiance, The Golden Palominos, Praxis, Massacre, Material, Buckethead, Painkiller, Ashes, Tabla Beat Science, Iggy Pop and Herbie Hancock.\u201d\n\n\u201cDave Lombardo is a Cuban American drummer and a co-founding member of the American thrash metal band Slayer. He performed with Slayer on seven albums, including their groundbreaking 1986 release Reign In Blood and their 2006 release Christ Illusion, for which he received critical praise. Lombardo\u2019s music career has spanned more than 25 years, during which he has been involved in the production of 29 commercial recordings extending over a number of genres with bands such as Grip Inc., Fant\u00f4mas, Philm, and Testament in addition to Slayer. Lombardo is most widely known as a very aggressive and exceptionally skilled heavy metal drummer. His use of the drums have been called \u201castonishingly innovative\u201d and earned him the title \u201cthe godfather of double bass\u201d from Drummer World. Over his career, he has had a significant influence on the metal scene and has inspired many modern metal drummers, particularly within both thrash metal and death metal.\u201d",

Since then, they have expanded east to NYC and west to Boise, ID (yes, THAT Boise, ID).\n\nThey have two main dishes on their menu: the first is a succulent \u201cAll-Request Show,\u201d with a generous helping of audience participation, flavored slightly by improvisation. The second is the hailed \u201cStop Making Sense Re-Creation,\u201d where they perform note-for-note and prop-for-prop the famous Talking Heads concert film from 1984. In 2011, they performed this show to a sold-out crowd at the Vic Theatre in Chicago.\n\nThis Must be the Band is extremely happy to play Talking Heads music night after night because the music is just that much fun. Not only has the lead singer (Charlie Otto) been called \u201cthe illegitimate son of David Byrne,\u201d but the band boasts its very own Tina Weymouth (Jamie Jay), Bernie Worrell (Jim Dinou), Adrian Belew (covered by both Otto and Dinou), and Ednah Holt (Kasey Foster).\n\nTMBTB is available for any gathering where people need to dance: parties, weddings, bars, etc.\n\nThis Must Be the Band\nhttp://www.thismustbetheband.com/",

Rarely in the international goth-industrial scene does one hear about it. On May 1st, 2008, Jim Semonik, longtime promoter, DJ, and frontman for electro-industrial band Rein, was diagnosed with stage 2B colorectal cancer. During a rigorous campaign of chemotherapy and radiation, Semonik\u2019s passion for this music did not waver. On June 28th, 2008, 16 Volt\u2019s Denial Highway Tour came through Pittsburgh courtesy of Jim. It was at this event that Semonik formulated the idea for a compilation that would not only be gargantuan in scale, but in quality as well. Jim asked 16 Volt frontman, Eric Powell, to be a part of it. Eric didn\u2019t hesitate and thus Electronic Saviors was born.\n\nWhen a person is stricken with a disease like cancer, it is important for the individual to not only focus on beating the disease, but have a goal for how to do it. Electronic Saviors is Jim\u2019s way of not only giving back to the medical community that saved his life, but the goth-industrial community that he has so warmly embraced for the better half of his life. It is Jim\u2019s way of crushing cancer once and for all.\n\nIn fall/winter of 2008, Semonik lost a portion of his digestive system and had to undergo a grueling program of post op chemotherapy. Jim almost lost his life due to a pancreatic infection from the chemo. This made the compilation of utmost importance. After recovering he began contacting bands throughout the scene that he had worked with and shared a great relationship with. It was not long before bands like Suicide Commando, Assemblage 23, Chemlab, Caustic, and his own band Rein would begin to work on all exclusive tracks and mixes for what would become one of the biggest compilations the scene has ever seen.\n\nA grand total of 83 artists came together for this project, and it is with this that Jim wants to donate proceeds to the Center For Cancer Research and Wellness in Harrisburg, PA.\n\nSaviors is a monumental 4 cd boxset, packaged nicely in DVD digipack format, featuring stunning artwork by Jeff Confer and a 12 page booklet including an essay from Jim and a drop card for a downloadable 5th cd. The content of the compilation covers the widest range of emotions that a cancer patient goes through. It ranges from melancholy moving songs (ThouShaltNot, Bow Ever Down, Encoder) to songs about the medical industry (SMP, Boole) to angry songs of loss (Suicide Commando, Rein, Acumen Nation) to pure anger and raging dance tracks (Nachtmahr, The Dark Clan, TERRORFAKT, Vicious Alliance), downtempo, ambient and tranquil pieces (Burikusu!!!, The Atomica Project), comedic (The Gothsicles, Caustic) and songs of hope (Interface, SD6 and Assemblage 23).\n\nThe success of the Electronic Saviors Project far exceeded everyone's expectations by having completely selling out of all copies of Volume 1, it saw well attended and packed live ES benefit shows/ release parties and  raised over $20,000 for the foundation of Cancer Research and Wellness. Well we all know that Cancer returning is any survivor's nightmare so Metropolis Records, in association with Distortion Productions presented Electronic Saviors Vol 2:Recurrence. This is a 6 or 8 disc (whichever you ordered) box set of exclusive tracks by some of the biggest names in the industrial genre to raise money for cancer research. Cancer survivor and long time promoter and DJ, Jim Semonik, assembled 142 artists from around the world.\n\nThis compilation contained 105 (standard edition) and 142 (premium edition) tracks in total, including new exclusive tracks and mixes by 16 Volt, Project Pitchfork, Covenant, Blutengel, Suicide Commando, System Syn, God Module, Cesium 137, The Dark Clan, Rein[Forced], Mesh and many more. Packaged in a DVD style digipak containing the 6 physical CDs as well as a bonus 2 cd digipack with sticker, wristband and 70 page BRICKS survivors stories booklet. Proceeds from this Boxset were donated to the Gilda's Club/Cancer Support Community (http://www.gildasclub.org/) and The Bone Marrow Foundation (http://www.bonemarrow.org/) where Jim Semonik and the Electronic Saviors project raised over $10,000 for those foundations\n\nFast Forward to 2014 and ES3: Remission\u2026.. \"You are cured!\" These words are a dream come true to any cancer patient. Scene promoter, DJ and frontman of electro-industrial act Rein[Forced], Jim Semonik, returns to give the vile disease of cancer another pummeling with a ton of his friends, comrades, heroes and allies in Electronic Saviors 3:Remission. Jim, creator of the series, recently celebrated 5 years cancer free and is eager to share his gift with the world. Semonik once again returns with an armada of talent to shake dance floors and crush eardrums. Brand new and exclusive tracks from Combichrist, 16 Volt, Hate Dept, Stromkern, Rein[Forced], Panic Lift, Ego Likeness, Left Spine Down, Aesthetic Perfection and many, many more make Electronic Saviors 3 an essential purchase. Limited to 1000 copies, this volume is expected to sell out quickly and become a collector's item. The Electronic Saviors series continues to grow with this 3rd volume. Jim once again dedicates this volume to anyone who has been a victim of cancer in any way, shape or form.\n\nJoin us for this special event that boasts artists from the compilation (as well as a guest from ES2) as they all come together to help raise awareness on the subject and also to celebrate the strength and resolve that cancer survivors show. All proceeds from this unique live event will go directly to the Gilda's Club/Cancer Support Community. The first Electronic Saviors Benefit show that we put together in 2010 had a near capacity turnout and the second edition of the Chicago release party saw outstanding performances from Ego Likeness, The Gothsicles and Cryogen Second. We are pleased to announce the special addition of a ES2 boxset artist, Servitor, who absolutely destroyed with his live set recently while on tour with Ego Likeness. He goes on early but if there was ever a opening support artist that you had to see than Servitor drum would be it!  Yes this evening starts a little early but this event will fill to capacity quickly and we would hate to have to turn people away at the door for such a good cause so please plan your evening accordingly.\n\n IVARDENSPHERE:\niVardensphere: Singularity\nMany who have seen iVardensphere are familiar with the intensity the band puts into their tribal performance. There have been upwards of 8 drummers on stage at a time during their shows creating that familiar rhythmic 'wall of sound'. The band has two sides, however. \nScott Fox's Singularity focuses on the electronic side of the project. With an emphasis on improvisation and crunch, no Singularity performance with be a clone of a previous show. Featuring a table full of electronics and audio manglers with no laptop in sight, Singularity is a one man performance that contains the punchy energy of the large show in a logistically easier package. \nSingularity also operates with an open stage concept. Members of the audience are free to come up and have a look at what is going on. Nothing is being hidden. Stand beside Fox as the music is coming to life. No barricades. Even setting up right in the middle of the floor has happened.\nWith punch, sweeping ambience, gut shaking bass and close up integration with the fans, this show shouldn't be missed.\n(Take tribal drums, mix with pounding analogue synths and a killer club sound and what do you get? Welcome to iVardensphere. \n\nThe new album, APOK, finds iVardensphere exploring different aspects of their sound, from dance floor stomping powernoise to more exotic flavors of tribal drumming blended with elements of trip-hop and a club-pleasing analog synth bumping EBM sound. APOK, iVardensphere's first release on Metropolis Records, also takes iVardensphere's passion for collaborations to a whole new level, bringing in guest artists including I:Scintilla, Caustic, God Module, and This Morn' Omina as well as featuring remixes by SKOLD, ESA, releveleR and Pull Out Kings.\n\nThe story of iVardensphere's rise begins a few years ago in Edmonton, Canada, where Scott Fox DJs the notorious club nights SICK and Das OOntz. Fox took his expertise in filling the dance floor and applied it to his passion for synths and industrial dance music to create a fresh take on the genre to form iVardensphere. Upon being heard for the first time by Vancouver-based label Synthetic Sounds, iVardensphere was immediately signed and the debut album Scatterface was released in July 2009, mastered by Sebastian Komor [Icon of Coil]. \n\nSoon after the completion of Scatterface, Scott enlisted the talents of Chris Lacroix [aka Siborg from Virtual Terrorist] to help bring the project from the studio to the stage, where the band shines. Ever since, iVardensphere has been constantly active live, having performed with acts ranging from Apoptygma Berzerk to Iszoloscope to 16Volt and Chemlab to Front Line Assembly at such places as Das Bunker in LA and the Kinetik Festival in Montreal. Buoyed by touring and word of mouth from an ever-growing fan base, iVardensphere has steadily swept across the industrial dance club scene in North America.\n\nAt the end of 2009, Scatterface made its way across the Atlantic on one of Europe\u2019s leading darkrock and industrial labels, Danse Macabre Records, as Fox prepared iVardensphere's second release, Remixes Vol. 1, featuring remixes from Komor Kommando, Memmaker, Left Spine Down and others. Initially a digital-only release, fans demand CDs, and so Remixes vol. 1 came out in February 2010 on Synthetic Sounds. This release also marked iVardensphere's first introduction to the college radio charts across Canada. \n\nThe summer of 2010 saw the band hit a wide range of cities and venues all across the USA and Canada with Iszoloscope and ad*ver*sary, gaining loads of new fans. Word of their powerful live shows continued to spread and they were asked to open Combichrist's North American tour in the fall of 2010, just in time for a new album to hit.\n\niVardensphere\u2019s much anticipated second studio album, Bloodwater, came out in November of 2010, showcasing Fox's growing interest in using tribal drumming and other more organic sounds alongside electronics and samplers. Spurned on by club play and word of mouth from the band\u2019s performances on Monsters on Tour with Combichrist, Bloodwater smouldered up the Canadian college radio electronic charts, eventually spending three months on !earshot\u2019s national electronic charts in early 2011 and nine weeks on ChartAttack\u2019s electronic charts. It also received great reviews, including in Outburn Magazine and Rue Morgue. \n\nThe fall 2010 tour with Combichrist went so well that iVardensphere was asked to come out on tour with Combichrist again in the spring of 2011.\n\nWherever they roam, iVardensphere are always eager to collaborate with other artists, including working with Booming Tree Taiko on their first tour with Combichrist and trading remixes with the likes of Rotersand. Past collaborations with Iszoloscope went so well that iVardensphere recently announced that Iszoloscope's Yann Faussurier became a full-fledged member of iVardensphere at the end of 2010, and Fox, Faussurier and Lacroix wasted no time in starting work on APOK alongside their collaborators. iVardensphere recently grew again as Iszoloscope and Memmaker's Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Scarfone also joined the fold as an official member after previously exchanging remixes with iVardensphere as Katastroslavia and co-writing on APOK.\n\nThe band's continuing growth and solid sounds caught the interest of industrial/electro powerhouse label Metropolis Records, who have now welcomed iVardensphere into the fold to help foster further expansion.)\n\nREIN[FORCED]:\n\nRein[Forced] started in 2003 from the ashes of Pittsburgh based electro/industrial band Forced. Jim Semonik, aka Jimmy Semtex, was the only original member from the band left. Rather than breaking up, he decided to reboot the band while staying true to the sound of the first cd, Cherophobia(released on DSBP, 2002). Fellow local musicians D.A. Turner and Ben Bloom joined Semtex and decided that the second album would be a lot more personal. In early 2006, the second album, Futile Longings of a Condecending Man(DSBP, 2006) was released and Included the singles \"Waster\" and \"Hiatus\". The band also released a limited edition cdr entitled I Can't Be Responsible For Remixes under the original Forced name and sold it at shows. Cherophobia and Futile Longings are now sold out.\n\nFollowing the release of Futile Longings, Rein[Forced] faced the loss of keyboardist, programmer, Ben Bloom. The band was devastated. The band took some time off and in 2007, started writing the follow up to Futile Longings, entitled X Amount Of Stabwounds In the Back. New songs \"Nausea\" and \"Dichotomy\" started to be included in live sets. However, as work continued on the new album, Semonik was diagnosed with stage 2B colorectal cancer and the album was placed on hold until he recovered. Semonik went through a harsh chemo/radiation treatment and almost died from a pancreatitis attack. During this time he compiled the Electronic Saviors:Industrial Music To Cure Cancer and released it on Metropolis Records in February of 2010. Rein[Forced] contributed a remix of new track \"Malignancy\". Semonik has also collaborated with Cleveland's Encoder, the U.K.'s Uberbyte and Pittsburgh's Prometheus Burning as well as Mindless Faith, Patricia Wake and a new side project called Borderlines.\n\nIn 2010, work resumed on X Amount, and got the attention of Chicago's WTII Records. Combining catchy synth hooks and coldwave inspired lyrics and attitude, Rein[Forced] provides a unique take on the current electo/industrial and EBM scene. Focusing more on song writing rather than club tracks that would be easily forgotten, Rein[Forced] provides a new depth to a style that has become forgotten in today's club scene while providing dancy grooves that will be remembered for years to come.\n\nDichotomy was released on April 3rd of 2012 and was the first single from the highly anticipated Rein[Forced] album \"X Amount of Stab Wounds in the Back\". This digital only single featured 6 versions of the title track including mixes by Stiff Valentine, Sensuous Enemy, Ego Likeness, Deathproof and The Dark Clan plus a special b-side\n\n2013 saw the return of Rein[Forced] with the remix companion to last year's X Amount of Stab Wounds in the Back. Pre-existing Conditions is a 2xCD set that features 25 remixes and an unreleased b-side, a cover of Machines of Loving Grace's hit Butterfly Wings. Remixers for Pre-existing Conditions include Inertia, Society Burning, Stiff Valentine, Imperative Reaction, Die Sektor, Ego Likeness, I,Scintilla, Mindless Faith and many more.\n\nRein[Forced] has shared the stage with some heavy scene hitters such as Imperative Reaction, Aesthetic Perfection, Pigface, Hanzel Und Gretyl, Bella Morte, Ego Likeness, Celldweller, Funker Vogt, Haujobb, Assemblage 23, Project Pitchfork, Chemlab, Terrorfakt, Acumen Nation, Interface, My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult and Chris Connelly. Semonik has also appeared on recent releases by The Dark Clan and Sonik Foundry. Stay tuned, there is much more to come.\n\nCRYOGEN SECOND:\nHailing all the way from Nashville, industrial/electro outfit,Cryogen Second is a powerful entry to the world of dark electronics. Featuring Eric Sochocki ( All Studio programming and vocals) Kevin Edlin (live guitars) and Asli Tiner (Live Synths), Cryogen Second's 2011 full length \"Anthem for the Great Self Destruct\" on Beyond Therapy records contained crunchy synthetic loops, heavy-hitting hooks, slick production, and nods to modern metal that are contained in each track, with lyrics that evoke fatalism and a ponderence on the very futility that dominates the human condition. Probably best known for their club track \"Clarity\" which first saw the light of day in 2010 , and can be found with remixes from Metropolis recording artist, Caustic and also Level 2.0 on the self-released Clarity EP\n\nBut Cryogen Second is a completely different beast live. While the album and EP'S are riddled with influences from bands like Meshuggah, Fear Factory, The Deftones, Pneumatic Detach, Prodigy, and Psyclon Nine, the live presentation becomes the sum of these parts, incorporating live guitars, synthesizers, and showmanship into a frenetic performance that is more reminiscent of the energy of a late 90's punk show than a modern dance outfit. This band has shared the stage with both metal and electronic bands such as Assemblage 23, Faderhead, FGFC820, Bella Morte, Ludovico Technique, Common Man Down, God Module, Espermachine, Angels on Acid, Ego Likeness and could be just as easily at home in a mosh pit or a dance floor, often bridging the two disparate influences in the same song.\n\nCryogen Second are also gaining a strong reputation for their solid remixes, having just completed deconstructing songs by Caustic, Inure, Level 2.0, Stahlnebel and WTII Records very own, State of the Union!\n\nSTANDARD ISSUE CITIZEN:\nStandard Issue Citizen has been leaving its mark across the northeast and midwest US since 2007. Originally a project of frontman Tim Mizerak, the band has since grown to become a full-fledged act.\n\nThey have shared the stage with many great industrial acts including Aesthetic Perfection, Nachtmahr, The Ludovico Technique, Psyclon Nine, Dawn of Ashes, Hanzel und Gretyl, Slick Idiot, Mankind Is Obsolete, Espermachine, and more!\n\nTheir first CD, Your Opinion Is Forfeit, was released in December 2010. It features a collection of the band's early works and was mixed by Isaac Glendening of Cesium_137. It was soon followed by the free SICfuck EP in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, the band embarked on their first tour of both the northeast and midwest regions of the United States and released a new single \"Superhero\" featuring remixes from numerous rising talents in the industrial scene.\n\nNow, in 2014, Standard Issue Citizen has been selected to be a part of Electronic Saviors: Industrial Music to Cure Cancer Volume 3 and will continue playing shows all over the US as they prepare to release their next album, due late Summer 2014.\n\nNew single \"Signals of Distress\" out 4.15.2014! Download the Superhero single and SICfuck EP for FREE from standardissuecitizen.com!\n\nSERVITOR:\nServitor reflects the living resurrected earth springing back through the decay of the failed industrial machine of many cities. The living breathing pulsing drums, the grinding, rhythmic machine of industry.\nMembers-Servitor\n\nSound-Servitor combines live percussion with foundations in traditional West African, Afro Cuban, Middle Eastern, Brazilian, and American tribal drums with a heavy, diverse and rich background of grinding industrial programming. A screaming, pulsing, thundering, music experience that is a massive departure from the usual approach to rhythms in electronic music.\nLive Servitor\u2019s unique setup and approach allows for performances along with other artists. Servitor has performed live with dancers and has played drums for other acts. Servitor\u2019s music has been used for fusion/bellydance performance tracks poi/fire performances and independent commercial advertisements. The best way to get the live feel of Servitor\u2019s drums in a dance/fire performance is to bring Servitor and the drums on stage.\n\nFollowers- Servitor\u2019s unique sound, and heavy emphasis on drums has thundered through the underworld to bring out the most unexpected, but entirely welcome cadre of dancers, artists and misfits. Among the masses of Servitor dendrophants are the raq-ing, shimmy-ing belly dancer, the vintage-teching steampunk, the boot-stomping rivethead, the drum circling skin pounders, the footloose African dancer, Ren Faire geeks and SCA enthusiasts. The audience of a Servitor show is always diverse and overflowing with creative, artistic minds. It\u2019s impossible not to fit in.",

It\u2019s become a vehicle for young people to express things they couldn\u2019t express in a classroom, in a conversation, or even in a written poem. To that end, wonderful spoken word events like Brave New Voices, CUPSI, and Chicago\u2019s own Louder Than a Bomb have catered to young, high school and college-aged poets. But here, in the birthplace of Slam, there are still very few opportunities for poets of all ages to perform together on equal ground\u2014not as mentors and mentees, but fellow students of our own voices. Fellow poets. \n\nTo that end, CGS will be a city-wide individual poetry slam open to performers of all ages, the goal being to bring together high school, college, and adult poets for a day-long poetry festival where we can write, teach, learn, and explore together. There will be cash prizes for the top three finalists, and various workshops and other performance events throughout the day for anyone with a festival, poet, or staff pass. \n\nRegistration will cost $30 per person (making it less expensive to enter than any other major slam), and Festival Passes will be $10 for adults and $5 for high school or college students. Festival volunteers will receive a free Staff Pass that guarantees their entry into all the day\u2019s events. \n\nRegardless of our age, our class, the number of books we\u2019ve published, or the number of slams we\u2019ve won, the poets of Chicago are all of the same lot. We live in a city of grand contradictions: A city known for great violence and great art, lavish corruption and grind-mode work, abject resignation, and endless wonder. Our poetry teaches us how to exist in this space. It teaches us how to speak up, and how to do it well. It comforts us, saddens us, moves us, and redeems us. It teaches us to find our voices, and then it teaches us how to use them. \n\nThis is an experiment. You are hereby cordially invited to the Chicago Grand Slam. \n\n\u2014Shaan Heng-Devan, Founder and Organizer",

        "description": "Legends of the Chicago underground since the 80s, ONO make their triumphant return to the Bottle tonight and are sure to wow/confound/destroy all in attendance like they have before. They've remained outsiders in a sea of outsiders, and if you've seen em before you know to expect the unexpected...it might be sparse electronic beats, motorik drums, guitar skronk, slinky bass riffs and rock theatre for the end of the world, or it might be the best Roxy Music cover you've never heard. ONO are heroes to all the freaks and they will never die. They will be aided by  Brett Naucke on sick synths.\n\nAn elusive rhythm & bluesman born in West Helena, Arkansas, T. VALENTINE first came to Chicago in 1950, when he was 18 years old, to make music and become a performer. VALENTINE has been performing his own renegade brand of off-kilter Chicago R&B/soul bag raunch ever since and he founded VAL Records in 1962, where he released \"Do the Do,\" \"Betty Sue,\" both of his versions of \"Black Power,\" and his biggest hit (for his ex-wife), \"Lucille Are You A Lesbian.\" Norton Records, who'd been looking for VALENTINE since the late-80s, finally tracked him down in 1999 and released a compilation album, Hello Lucille, in 2000, which is the same year T. VALENTINE made his Empty Bottle debut! Tonight the 80-plus years old T. Valentine will be performing with his new backing band THE VELCRONICS (Velcro Lewis Group plus one James Porter) so don't miss it!\n\nBIL VERMETTE has been recording and performing electronic music since the early 70s--probably longer than you've been alive (but maybe not, who knows). His 1984 album Katha Visions, a private press super-rarity, was just reissued by the fine folks at Permanent Records/Galactic Archives (Plastic CW's imprint), who say \"Fans of all things SYNTH absolutely must hear this LP.\" VERMETTE makes ambient synth dirges that are repetitive, layered and soothing ala krautgods Cluster and Tangerine Dream, and he's joined by the organizer of tonight's event, PLASTIC CRIMEWAVE, making the performance about as rare and special as it gets.\n\nBorn in 1945 in Chicago, JIM CUOMO is a saxophonist and composer who has made brainwaves melt from the 60s through the 80s with experimental psych band SPOILS OF WAR and witchy acid-folk group MORMOS, not to mention collaborations with John Cage, T.Rex, the Monty Python-connected Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band  and his pioneering solo computer/8-bit music for the Commodore 64 (try and compete with that CV, I dare you!) Joined for this show by ANNIE THE HAT and ELLIOTT DELMAN (of Mormos/Spoils of War), JIM's woodwind improvisations (acoustic and digital) have been reunited with his classic compositions from the 60's and his game music from the 80's into a completely unique live show.",

Amos In Ohio was based around acoustic guitar, synth keyboards, and lo fi live drums. \n5. followed by Find Love, Let Go EP  in 2007\n6. spawned live fan favorite \"Get Mad\"\n7. and acoustic ballad \"Lackluster Love\" was featured in the indie movie \"Cherry\" \n8. 2008 started Elephant Lady Records and released Real Blasty\n9. featuring the electro pop song \"Sushi\"\n10. KANGAROO EP in 2010 featured the song \"You Always Make Me Smile\"\n11. an infectiously sunny acoustic pop song that became familiar around the world in various TV uses.\n12. 2011 saw the release of full length #3, Robot Learn Love\n13. Loud electric guitars, deep and dark synth bass, heavily processed \"pop\" vocals\n14. co produced by Chris Grainger\n15. 2013 Brighter Than The Sun\n16. a consistently \"positive\" record from front to back\n17. co produced by Chris Grainger\n18. featured \"The Way to Wonder\" a whimsical acoustic song\n19.the video sent Kyle on an Ipad to space singing the song, it was pretty rad. \n\n----\nJONNY DRAKE (http://jonnydrake.bandcamp.com/)\n\nJonny returns to the Chicago music scene on the heels of wrapping production of his upcoming \"Lovers\" LP, after a year on hiatus. Drake's solo group is a seven piece, pulling talent from Jaime Rojo, Magical Beautiful, Brother George, and more. Daniel Villarreal on drums, Jim Drake on organ/guitar, Nick Broste on keys, Neal Neumann on bass, with Ann Marie Meiers and Christine Chung Kenny on backing vocals. Jonny's unique banjo and acoustic focused neo-folk sound recalls that of Roy Orbison, Neil Young, Grandaddy, Kurt Vile, and at times The National. Simple and dark, analog and tape driven, the new material is hypnotic and addictive. \n\n----\nJEFF TAYLOR (http://jefftayloralive.bandcamp.com)\n\nThe title track of Jeff Taylor's new EP, 'Organelle,' originally emerged as a dream dialogue. Taylor envisions himself alone in a dark room, left behind by a lost love who haunts his memory. The world around them is melting, all color and stories from their doomed relationship running in anastomotic streams. \n\nWith musical roots in Taylor's Western Pennsylvania writing sessions of the previous January, the song stood out to Bartlett as a candidate for potential recording sessions. \n\nThe tail end of 2013 was spent writing and recording his first solo EP, 'Organelle.' Producer Thomas Bartlett is featured on piano throughout, along with a cadre of local musicians who are also Taylor's dear friends. The release is a limited pressing of 45RPM 10\" vinyl, and will be available through the standard digital outlets.\n\nJeff spent a good part of 2012/2013 touring with Trixie Whitley and Kishi Bashi. He finished out the year with his stage debut as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa\u2019s '200 Motels.' In 'Motels,' Taylor sang with the Los Angeles Philharmonic for the 10th Anniversary Celebration of Disney Concert Hall.\n\nThe 'Organelle' EP is out April 1, 2014 on Rockwood Music Hall Recordings. Visit jefftayloralive.bandcamp.com to listen and purchase.\n-----\nACE REPORTER (http://yearling.fm/)\n\nA rooftop overlooking Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue. A fleabag motel on the banks of the Susquehanna River. A bus winding through sleepy Chicago suburbs. A book-filled bedroom. A sculpture garden in Washington, D.C. \n\nThese are the memories that inhabit Ace Reporter\u2019s debut LP, Yearling. They are memories from a single year, one that musician Chris Snyder spent writing and recording one new song every day. In 2010, after the breakup of his longtime band The States, Snyder, a songwriter, composer, vocalist, and multi-instrumentalist based in Brooklyn, embarked on what he called the threesixfive project. Each day came with a mandate for the musician to start and finish a new track. From this burgeoning collection of songs, four EPs emerged, which Snyder \u2013 who began playing violin at age four and landed his first singing gig as the featured boy soprano on the soundtrack for The Crow \u2013 eventually transformed into a full-length album culled from the experiences and inspirations that propelled him through that year. \n\nYearling was recorded in a converted barn in upstate New York in the spring of 2011. The idea was to take ten of the best songs from Snyder\u2019s massive collection and imbue them with greater life and augmented instrumentation. \u201cDuring the threesixfive project, I had two hours every evening to write, record, and mix a new song,\u201d Snyder says. \u201cThis meant that I had to give up on premeditation \u2013 whatever happened when I sat down to write became the song, period.\u201d\n\nThe album has the effect of a kaleidoscope, where Snyder\u2019s poetic lyricism and evocative imagery draw the songs together to create a collection that tells the story of a year, each song refracting a different memory of a time and place.",

This has given him the ability to speak directly to you through the computer, a miracle you will only now come to fully appreciate:\n\nMy Name Is Tiga. Welcome to the Bio-Dome, mec!\n\nAs you know, my remix work has slowed considerably as of late. While my versions of tracks by Alter Ego, New Young Pony Club, The Gossip and Human League have only enhanced my reputation as the Sex Whiz of Sonic Parkour, I felt I needed to start hoarding my best ideas for my own music. The remix of Alter Ego\u2019s \u201cGary\u201d, for instance, forced me to cannibalize much of the work I\u2019d done in my now-legendary sessions with Bobby McFerrin. It was then that I knew that I had to draw the line.\n\nThe seeds for ZZT, my ongoing collaboration with Zombie Nation, when we hit it off at the semi-biannual Gigolo High-Earners Galmour Pageant and Hot Meal. After falling out with Gigolo over accusations of cyber-arson, I approached him about working together, possibly on music. I soon came to love his thing-throwing, humor-having ways. Our tracks tend to be \u201clive\u201d in nature, in that we try to only use parts that require four hands at a time. Or 19 fingers and three lips. It depends.\n\nRainier Werner Bassfinder takes everything great about my work with Jesper Dahlback and takes it to a new level. One that forces me to use a fake name. I chose the moniker \u201cThe Dove\u201d for reasons contractual and shame-based. Probably 70/30, contract/shame. Oh, Michael Gothard, I only wanted to do right by you!\n\nOver the past few years, I have continued to tour the globe extensively. I have eaten Club Sandwiches in over 60 countries and done \u201cThe Sandwich\u201d in over 600 clubs. I was also brave enough to visit the Middle East, with a harrowing trip to war-ravaged Dubai. I was taken falconing (this is 100 percent true), which was strange enough before I found out that the falcons undergo extensive plastic surgery to look more like celebrities. My falcon, I was told, was supposed to resemble Ethan Hawke. I don\u2019t know who that is.\n\nThe past few years have also seen a resurgence at my record label, Turbo. The work done by Thomas Von Party in A&R and Oliver Interactive in International Business Affairs has been invaluable. I can\u2019t express how much I appreciate their efforts in making Turbo the Towerhorse it is today. I would be remiss, however, in not mentioning the real star of the show, our Branding Consultant, Brandon Branding.\n\nBrandon saw ways of expanding our brand in new and exciting directions. He insisted I start participating in community soccer leagues to lend an \u201ceveryman\u201d quality to my daunting brilliance. I was skeptical at first, but soon I came to treasure seeing the faces of 50-year-old men in goggles light up as I take the field. I am a defense-minded, vaguely passive-aggressive midfielder, and have trained online with Ghana international Michael Essien.\n\nMr. Branding also encouraged me to write for the label, birthing a torrid run of press sheets that has sparked in me a love of letters deep and true. Now I write all the time. I even replaced my car\u2019s paneling with dry-erase board, so that I may lean out the driver\u2019s seat window at a moment\u2019s notice to scrawl away at the face of literature.\n\nToday, our reach extends even further, thanks to my venturing into the world of amateur inventing. There\u2019s the Grocery Claw, aimed at those who rightly abhor what I call Market Filth. And, with an eye towards the future of our planet, Solar-Powered Wind.\n\nMost importantly, 2009 will see the release of my new LP, \u201cCiao!\u201d This album will surely cement my status as a Storytella and Funky Fella. \u201cCiao!\u201d is the fruit of 15 months of collaborations with such leading lights as Soulwax, Jesper Dahlback, Gonzales, Jori Hulkonnen, Jake Shears and James Murphy. An impressive roster, to say the least. What was that? What do you mean, \u201cWhat?\u201d That sound you just made! It was like a snort, a dismissive snort. have you worked with, then, genius? Sting Jr.? That weirdo form Simply Red? Lady Sting? I am not impressed in the least.\n\nAll in all, at the end of the day, I can\u2019t help but gaze into the reflecting pool and think to myself, \u201cI guess I really turned the night on, huh?\u201d\n\n1976 \u2013 2003, \u201cThe Creation Myth\u201d\n\u201cThe citizen may take a bride, but it is the rifleman who takes a lover. Ultimately we all must choose either the myth or the mountain.\u201d\n\nThe origins of Montreal born DJ-producer-incipient Teutonic legend Tiga lie to the vague and troubling East, where he was weaned on the nefarious milk of the notorious 1980s Indian club scene.\u201cTo the unforgiving eye,\u201d he says of the sybaritic night-kingdom,\u201ca world of filth and decadence is revealed. For example, I\u2019m fairly certain that more than a few club owners had an unsavory arrangement with the man who brought the folding chairs. I was at once appalled and enraptured. After that, I had no choice in the matter.\u201d\n\nBy 1990, Tiga had returned to Montreal, prodigiously nightwise and unsatisfied with the existing local club scene (calling it \u201cthe plumage of a bird I cannot bring myself to want.\u201d) With the help of a core group of friends, he began to throw a series of small parties infused with the sense of dead-eyed ennui gleaned from a past littered with acid whores and crazed Indian gamblers. Other innovations which Tiga introduced to Montreal party culture include guest DJs, intense street promotions featuring rival gangs of street acrobats, color flyers, multi-dj sets, and leading the supplicant crowd through the innermost corridors of one\u2019s soul.\n\nIt was this heady time of dizzying innovation and ravenous sexual ambition, which culminated in the birth of 1993\u2019s \u201cSolstice,\u201d generally, considered to be Montreal\u2019s first genuine rave. (A year earlier, a hyper-prescient Tiga staged \u201cEclectricity,\u201d the first online rave, a project whose utter failure remains a source of bafflement: \u201cIt broke my heart, given my views on diversity . . . I am, I feel, a very interactive person.\u201d) Tiga has since helped to orchestrate no less than ten major events, including \u201cThe Orb Live,\u201d \u201cPure,\u201d and the very first North American appearance of continental illusionist Jean-There.\n\nIn 1994, Tiga bought DNA Records, a small medical data concern, and parlayed it into Montreal\u2019s premiere electronic music boutique. \u201cWe\u2019ve always believed in putting the customer first, from helping you find that one minimal house record that will make your collection to offering concerned looks as you wade through the enormous backlog of test results to discover if you are in fact afflicted with a congenital disease.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, Tiga privately sang about the death of actor and poet Tupac Shakur.\nThat same year, the Montreal dance community found a haven for the boldest feats of dance, where fools are in love with mystery and sex-valor is prized above all else. Sona (meaning literally \u2018Liar-dancer\u2019) was initially conceived of by Tiga and his two partners as \u201ca perverse, jeering monolith, because nothing is sacred anymore\u201d but it has evolved into much more. In addition to its place among the pantheon of urban groove centers, on weekdays it rents out its facilities, at a very reasonable rate, to a local program dedicated to teaching homeless men to dance properly (\u201cI just think it\u2019s an important project,\u201d Tiga said at the time).\n\nIn 1998, Tiga started Turbo Recordings as an outlet for his wildman organ escapades but he soon found a host of other artists who were willing to be paid to record for him. Turbo has released over 20 albums, 2 samplers, and 12 vinyl twelve inches as well as secured global distribution with Prime, Intergroove and Caroline. Notable releases include Peter Benisch\u2019s \u201cSoundtrack Saga,\u201d Christopher Handlebar\u2019s \u201cTo a Time of Asia\u201d and Tiga\u2019s own \u201cMixed Emotions\u201d and \u201cAmerican Gigolo\u201d\n\nBy 2001, however, overwork and media saturation began to show their strain, as evidenced by Tiga\u2019s hysterical outburst at a fashion photographer during a promo shoot:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll sit for your venal cigarette pictures, but I will not indulge you in your game of \u2018Eyes! Lies! Surprise!\u2019 I dare you, coward\u2014call out your cloakmen! What are you waiting for? The truth?!\u201d\n\nFollowing a month spent riding horses and caring for his voice, Tiga entered the studio with producer Zyntherius \u201cJori\u201d Hulkonnen and a singular vision: \u201celectro, but mainly about my eyes.\u201d The result, a searing rendition of his former Mother Mio bandmate Corey Hart\u2019s solo smash \u201cSunglasses at Night,\u201d challenged dancers and seduced critics alike, yet Tiga is coy when asked about its impact, particularly in Germany: \u201c\u2019Sunglasses\u2019 is a sinless child, a gleaming medallion. But is also a trick, a trick of memory. You must understand \u2013 on a whim, we revealed the hidden fire of Europe.\u201d\n\nBut fires need tending and lumber. And so the onslaught of Tiga-powered releases was fated to continue. They are his craft, his life, his living craft-fire.\n\n\u201cWe live in the Age of Cruelty and every day I struggle to find my place in it. All I know I can offer the world is a thousand more adventures through dancing and light.\u201d\n\n2003 \u2013 2006, \u201cGet on Top of the Fire\u201d\nIf \u201cSunglasses at Night\u201d marked Tiga\u2019s coronation as the steely Wolf-King of Dance Mountain, then his subsequent remixes for the likes of Martini Bros., Alpinestars, Linda Lamb, Crossover, FC Kahuna, Cabaret Voltaire, Telepopmusik, Felix da Housecat, Fischerspooner, FPU, The Devils (Nick Rhodes), and Danni Minogue birthed his dewy-eyed heir, Darian. Says Tiga, \u201cI have also produced remixes for City Rockers, and singles for Turbo Recordings, Intec, Drumcode, and Electrix with Mateo Murphy under the name TGV. I am also the hidden hero of the ongoing NHL lockout. I will break the players\u2019 will \u2013 you have my solemn word.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Tiga took his conqueror\u2019s tools to the streets, with a heralded mix CD for !K7\u2019s DJ Kicks series, and an ethereal reading of Nelly\u2019s \u201cHot in Herre,\u201d which became a stalwart success and was subsequently licensed in the UK by Skint (in the UK) and Warner Music (the GAS region). The video, which can be seen at http://www.eyeballnyc.com/tiga, is a revelation of neo-urban dazzle-do, courtesy of the puppet wizardry of Tiga\u2019s brother, the Lord of the Marionette (www.lordofthemarionette.com).\n\nTiga was also gracious enough to lend his wind-shattering vocals to Richard X\u2019s \u201cYou (Better Let Me Love YouX4) Tonight,\u201d as well as \u201cHeartbreak/Ananda,\u201d by Beyer & Lenk (Adam Beyer and Jesper Dahlback), and Rik Stamina\u2019s \u201cDancing Inside You.\u201d His remix work on Alex Kidd\u2019s \u201cCome With Me\u201d, Neon Judgement\u2019s \u201cTV Treated,\u201d Scissor Sisters\u2019 cover of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cComfortably Numb,\u201d \u201cDa Hype,\u201d by Junior Jack and Robert Smith, and Peaches\u2019 \u201cShake Yer Dix,\u201d and Soulwax\u2019s \u201cE Talking\u201d comprises a merciless Crimson Romance, lapping at the shores of eternity.\n\nTiga\u2019s smash single \u201cPleasure From The Bass\u201d, a two-fisted jackal that drew a line in the dancefloor sand, was released in 2004 on the Belgian imprint PIAS.\n\n2005 saw remixes for Depeche Mode, The Vests, Moby, LCD Soundsystem, Mylo, Phillipe Zdar, Chelonius Jones, Drama Society, Thomas Andersson and countless others. In October, Tiga womanized the world with \u201cYou Gonna Want Me\u201d, his toothsome duet with Jake Shears (of Scissor Sisters\u2019 fame), \u201cOnce again, I proved you can\u2019t spell \u2018sword\u2019 without \u2018words\u2019\u201d says the dance-freckled Disco Jockler.\n\n2006 began with the release of Tiga\u2019s debut album Sexor, which sounded the clarion call of an emergent Nation-Man. \u201cIt is an exhilarating time \u2013 the woes and the whoas, the thrills and the throes! Like Icarus, I have flown dangerously close to the fun, on a dare to wear my overalls undone.\u201d\nTiga then embarked on the \u201cSexor over Europe\u201d and \u201cSexor over Canada\u201d tours in a manner befitting The Most Compassionate Man Alive. \u201cSoon I will position Sexor over America and Sexor over Japan, forcing rapt smiles onto the faces of the discovantaged, those fey, oblivious costumers\u2019 sons\u2026\u201d, he said.\n\nThat same year, Tiga made you go \u201cTig-unnggghh!\u201d with the video for the single, \u201c(Far From) Home.\u201d Shot in Tokyo, the clip follows Tiga on a soul-laughening journey down a street of some sort. The video was helmed by Nagi Noda, the accalimed Japanese director of the groundbreaking music video for Yuki\u2019s \u201cSentimental Journey\u201d, a short film, Ex Fat Girl, which features exercising poodles, and projects for Nike and Laforet, for which she has won a host of prizes in Japan, not the least of which being Tiga\u2019s coveted \u201cAdmiration-in-Japan\u201d Medal.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201c(Far From) Home\u201d single left mankind fitted for underjeans, provocatively asking listeners \u201cAre you a DoJ or a Don\u2019tJ?\u201d The release included remix work by the DFA, Digitalism, and Chicken Lips, showcasing Tiga\u2019s incredibly exotic voice in new sonic locales, as well as a remix by Tiga himself, \u201cThe Speed of Sexor Reprise.\u201d A well-meaning dub edit by Jon Aerosmith & Eduardo B. Rich was politely declined.\n\nTiga\u2019s reign of wonder continued to not stop, as he dutifully drew up the dance contracts for tracks by Coldcut and Pet Shop Boys. \u201cAs both a student \u2013 and a significant part \u2013 of history, I feel it would be a betrayal of my stewardship to ever remix music in anger. It is not the Way of the Musician, nor is it the Musician\u2019s Way.\u201d\n\n\nABOUT GREEN VELVET\nChange has been a constant theme throughout the successful career of Green Velvet, but as he has crossed genres, explored themes from the comedic to the serious and changed monikers, the common thread running through the music he has made for nearly two decades is its roots in and dedication to the Chicago House sound.\n\nHis first transformation came when he left master\u2019s degree studies in chemical engineering at UC-Berkeley to turn a hobby into a career making music, influenced by the sounds he had been exposed to as a science-fiction-loving, video-game-playing kid whose father was a part-time Chicago DJ.\n\nAs Cajmere, he released his inaugural Underground Goodies EP in 1991 on his Cajual label, keeping true to the early House sound. He quickly followed it up the next year with the smash hit \u201cCoffeepot (It\u2019s Time for the Percolator).\u201d\n\nNot one to rest on his success, he soon changed things up, teaming with vocalist Dajae for \u201cBrighter Days,\u201d a more mellow House tune, this one released by Emotive. That pairing would be his last with a female vocalist until his recent partnership with rapper Kid Sister for \u201cEverybody Wants.\u201d\n\nThe 17 years in between those two projects witnessed an incredible array of electronic music emanating from this prolific artist, as well as a second label under his direction, Relief. Adopting the persona Green Velvet (not to mention a Day-Glo shock wig) for his techno-oriented pieces and DJ appearances, he became the champion of new wave Chicago beats through the \u201990s-known best for hits such as \u201cPreacher Man,\u201d \u201cFlash\u201d (a No. 1 U.S. dance hit in 1995), and 1997\u2032s laugh-inducing \u201cAnswering Machine.\u201d The decade ended with his first album, Constant Chaos in 1999.\n\nThe new century brought a compilation album, Green Velvet, during a brief signing with Warner Bros. Records\u2019 short-lived F-111 imprint, and a production album, Whatever, on Relief. The punk-inspired Whatever explored darker themes than his previous work, including racism (\u201cWhen?\u201d), drug use (\u201cGenedefekt\u201d and \u201cLa La Land\u201d), alienation (\u201cSleepwalking\u201d) and bending to authority (\u201cGat\u201d).\n\n\u201cLa La Land\u201d went on to become by far the biggest selling track of his career. His live act expanded as he began playing a keytar, with two other musicians-Nazuk and Spaceboy-backing him, playing heavily distorted synths.\n\nThe last decade also saw Green Velvet become a fan favorite across Europe, playing to huge crowds at festivals in addition to live radio appearances and club gigs. Numerous side projects and remixes under various names also added to his seemingly nonstop musical output.\nIn 2005, Green Velvet released his third album, Walk In Love, which stayed true to the House sound, with a few pop- and punk-oriented tracks for good measure, including \u201cCome Back\u201d and \u201cPin-Up Girl,\u201d both of which featured a live guitarist.\n\nThe ongoing evolution in the music, career and life of the artist born Curtis Alan Jones in Chicago has been and will continue to be fascinating to watch and experience for his many followers.\n\nOver the past seven year\u2019s Green Velvet has released some of his most beloved anthems, including \u201cShake and Pop\u201d, \u201cEverybody Wants\u201d, \u201cMilli Vanilli\u201d. Riding the wave of critical acclaim and success, Green Velvet has been touring the globe stopping at some of the most respected clubs and festivals along way.\n\nIn addition to his solo work, he has been collaborating with some of underground dance music\u2019s most respected and popular producers, including Maceo Plex, Jamie Jones, Danny Tenaglia, Pleasurekraft, Phil Kieran, Carl Craig, Derrick Carter, Crookers and DJ Sneak.",

        "description": "We are incredibly excited to be hosting the Chicago Premiere of the wonderful Italian atmospheric horror film ACROSS THE RIVER with our friends over at Chicago Filmmakers. This screening will be on June 7th at 8pm. View the trailer here:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/4RTNz6pNtcg\n\n For more information, here is the synopsis:\n\n\u201cA wildlife biologist has set up a variety of trophy cameras along a path in the remote Italian mountains. Living alone in a cabin, he collects data daily, reviewing footage, studying animal behaviour and their tracks, on the hunt for ever-elusive wild beasts. Occasionally, strange items appear, such as a beautiful piece of cloth flowing down the river, from what appears to have been a dress. One day, he takes his camper further down the road and ventures past the river, which traps him unknowingly on its opposite shore. Wandering deeper and deeper within the forest, an abandoned village catches his attention, and what he discovers within its walls, lurking at night, unseen, is far more unnerving than he could have imagined. The darkness engulfs him. Meanwhile, an old man watches over it all, guardian of a terrible secret.\u201d\n\nOne of the most downright efficient, atmospheric horror film of 2013 and a chilling discovery from Italy, ACROSS THE RIVER prioritizes a slow-building, intense crescendo approach to its atmosphere of disorientation and dread, forsaking cheap scares for the sake of terrific sound design, carefully placed shadows and rustling leaves. Thrusting you deeper and deeper into the clutches of his dark, otherworldly woods, director Lorenzo Bianchini offers an almost dialogue-less hybrid of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (without it being subjective found footage) and INTO THE WILD, pulling you into the supernatural wilderness one discovery at a time, insidiously even, until you are, like his protagonist, completely trapped and at the mercy of what lies within. The unique infrared wildlife footage peppered throughout takes on a vividly evocative quality, as uncanny images of the wilderness are produced, forcing you to wonder as to what is really there. A classical horror tale spun from the interstices of man and his digital technologies as confronted with the (super)natural world of yore, ACROSS THE RIVER is a brilliant opposition of new and old narratives, building towards a downright terrifying finale. Wander, wonder and dare cross the river, you will be glad you did. (Thanks to Ariel Esteban Cayer of Fantasia and Pop Montreal for the write up!)\n\nThis is the first time that this film has been screened in America! Do not miss this wonderful Italian horror film. Here is all of the info:\n\nACROSS THE RIVER\nLocation: Chicago Filmmakers\n5243 N Clark St. 60640\nDate: Saturday, June 7th\nTime: 8:00pm\nTicket price: $7.00 at door\n\nLooking forward to seeing you all there!",

        "description": "Incorrect Music & Paradigm Underground Present\n\nTHE INCORRECT MUSIC LOFT PARTY\nfeaturing \n\nANTHONY ATTALLA\nCOCODRILLS\nw/ special guest Dustin Sheridan \n\nSaturday, April 5th \nLocation TBA ~ Chicago, IL\nDoors at 12 midnight\n\nAdvance tickets highly recommended, space is limited:\nwww.wantickets.com/incorrectchicagoLOFT\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIncorrect Music frontman Anthony Attalla teams up with the Paradigm crew to bring the sound back underground, featuring 7+ hours of proper house showcased in an off-site loft space.  Along with Attalla, Space Miami residents Cocodrills will be flying up from South Beach to make a special appearance in the Windy City.  Opening the night is Chicago favorite and Spybar resident, Dustin Sheridan.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nANTHONY ATTALLA\nIncorrect Music // Chicago, IL\n\nAs we enter 2014, Anthony Attalla has firmly established himself as a rising star in the electronic music community.  His personal growth in the studio as a producer and on stage as a performer has the industries biggest taste makers, as well as its biggest publications, proclaiming that Anthony is set to break out in the coming year.  Never resting on his laurels, Anthony has also demonstrated his passion for the business side of the industry by creating a platform to showcase his favorite talent through Incorrect Music, his music production-company, which has proven to be a most successful endeavor.  \n\nAs an artist, Anthony has charted over 50 Top 100 tracks on Beatport.com, the widely popular outlet for purchasing Dance Music.  With popular labels such as Sony, Atlantic, Warner Bros, Ultra, and Toolroom seeking his productions as well as underground heavyweights Suara, Great Stuff, 1605, Trapez, Tronic, Break New Soil, MBF, and Stereo Recordings, Attalla has become a wanted man.  In addition, the demand for his live performance has grown to an all-time high with continuous touring throughout the United States, as well as international bookings in Europe, Ibiza, Mexico & Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Canada.  Furthermore, Anthony made his mark this summer on the White Isle (Ibiza, Spain) as he was asked to support Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso on their newly formed 'Departures' project.  The residency at the uber exclusive Ushuaia Hotel & Pool showcased the world's most in-demand talent and is arguably Ibiza's hottest ticket.\n\nNow surpassing its three-year anniversary, Incorrect Music has experienced success at an alarming pace.  The label\u2019s achievements include having tracks played and charted by some of the industries\u2019 most credible artists, boasting over 70 Top 100 tracks on various Beatport Charts, and spreading its wings globally with artists from more than 20 different countries making up its impressive roster.\n\nWith Anthony\u2019s multi-faceted approach to an increasingly demanding industry, he illustrates his ability to evolve and achieve as he continues to make his meteoric rise in international dance scene.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCOCODRILLS\nIncorrect Music // Miami, FL\n\nWhere they're from or how they grew up is entirely irrelevant. When they started off and what their influences were are inconsequential. Listing the popular venues they've played or name dropping artist that support them would be disingenuous. This is because a short anecdotal paragraph loaded with DJ/producer cliches wouldn't do their style, or their sound, any justice. The Cocodrills (Christian \"Pridef\" Diaz, Adam Cruz) pride themselves on creating a unique musical experience, which can only be just that; experienced. But make sure to leave your pretense at the door 'cause you won't find any bullshit at one of their parties; only funky grooves, positive vibes and rampant debauchery. And while they don't claim to have reinvented the wheel, they do like to take that wheel down the road of sound for a ride so wild it wakes up the next morning with no tread smelling of burnt rubber and a wondrous sense of \"let's do that again!\". Act accordingly.",

Starting this January Excision will hit the road only weeks after wrapping the final string of Destroid live shows for 2013. \n\nEmbracing an unyielding pursuit to push the boundaries of bass music, Excision is continually creating and re-imagining innovative uses of cutting edge technology to impact his fans, as well as the EDM community at large. This 2014 Tour will prove to be his most extensive and most immersive tour experience to date. With an already phenomenal level of production at his disposal, you better believe he has gone even further. He is stepping things up to a whole new level and bringing a monstrous 150,000 watts of sound, which is capable of delivering insanely loud yet crystal clear audio to blast dance floors with room shaking bass in a way that bass music is ultimately designed to be felt as well as heard.\n\nThe 2014 tour also marks the return of the 28 foot wide, 15 foot tall mammoth video and lighting installation known as The Executioner. This custom crafted stage production was specifically designed for Excisions 3D video mapped visual sequences as he DJ's both music and video live on stage. The Executioner is fully recharged and returning as Excision\u2019s on-stage bass bunker, complete with brand new 3D visual animations displayed across its 420 square feet of surface area. This technological audio video monstrosity is equipped with various sliding panels and pneumatics to hide lazers, fog machines, an extensively upgraded lighting system and more than a few surprises yet to be revealed.\n\n\nDirtyphonics\n-\nDirtyphonics, the fabulous french DJ team joins with Excision for his 2014 tour. Bringing their signature style of genre bending madness from DNB, Electro House and everything in between, don't miss a second of their electrifying sets as they set the world on fire!\n\n\n\n\nIll.Gates \n-\nIll.Gates is a Toronto-based composer, performer and educator. Over the past 16 years, he has established a global fanbase and a reputation as one of the most dynamic electronic music artists around. He regularly tours across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Gates has headlined at such festivals as Burning Man, Shambala, the World Electronic Music Festival and the New Orleans Jazz Festival. His first full-length release, Autopirate (Muti Music, 2008) charted and continues to sell strongly. His upcoming triple album The ill.Methodology and accompanying online course are highly anticipated. Gates was recently selected as one of the Next 100 by URB Magazine.\n\nMany of his contemporaries cite ill.Gates as a key artistic influence and inspiration in their music. While on tour, Gates frequently teaches workshops to grateful and attentive audiences, in which he shares his highly effective approach to producing quality finished music as well as insights into the mentality and strategies necessary to succeed in the music business.",

The venue is located one mile west of Lake Michigan and is conveniently nestled within unique dining and shopping experiences. \n\nThe Flow Show anticipates a delightful evening.

Our free programs create a safe community for individuals to come together as they enter new challenges of adulthood with epilepsy. Our mission is simple: no one should stand alone.\n\nHaving struggled with epilepsy since the age of 7, I look back and wish there had been times in my rocky journey in which I could've related to someone going through a similar experience. This is why we are here and have created something lacking in the Chicago community. I am proud to be a part of this effort. \n\nHere is the link to purchase tickets or donate to the event. We do have an early bird ticket price that ends today so grab 'em now!! \n\nhttp://epilepsychicago.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&eventID=554 \n\nThe early bird ticket price of $75 ($85 regular beginning March 13) includes heavy appetizers, beer, wine and a signature cocktail, dancing, DJ, \"fake\" gambling money and some awesome raffles to bid on. Come dressed in cocktail attire, ready for a red carpet photo opp! \n\nIf you have questions, msg me or email at msultemeier@epilepsychicago.org \n\nThank you for your support. \n\nLove,\nMaria",

Hornsgatan Ramblers, (tidigare Handsome Fred and his Tall Kings of Tempo)  bildades f\u00f6r snart 5 \u00e5r sedan och det av unga swing entusiaster som hade lindy hop-dans som sitt st\u00f6rsta intresse. Faktum \u00e4r att alla bandets medlemmar tr\u00e4ffades, mer eller mindre, nere p\u00e5 Chicago swing dance studios dansgolv. Vissa av dem hade d\u00e5 inte ens r\u00f6rt ett instrument och det faktum att de nu f\u00f6r tiden turnerar runt bland Europas st\u00f6rsta swingfestivaler verkade d\u00e5 ganska osannolikt. Detta band har sj\u00e4l och hj\u00e4rta i dansant swingmusik. Med en blandad repertoar av tolkningar av k\u00e4nda s\u00e5v\u00e4l som ok\u00e4nda swingl\u00e5tar fr\u00e5n legender som Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Jimmie Lunceford, Louis Jordan med m\u00e5nga fler s\u00e5 v\u00e5gar vi lova en h\u00e5rt sv\u00e4ngande kv\u00e4ll.\n\nVarmt v\u00e4lkomna!\nMVH\nCHICAGO swing dance studio\nHornsgatan 75\nwww.chicago75.se",

(http://www.hftd.org) \n \nOn Friday September 7th, 2012 a collection of musicians, peers, co-workers, friends and family gathered together to put on a memorial concert at the Bottom Lounge in Chicago to celebrate the life of Jamie Duffy who had passed away earlier that year. The Memorial show was referred to as Cold Waves: The Jamie Duffy Concert, in no small part due to the high number of \u201cCold Wave\u201d artists who participated in it. Cold Wave is considered to be a sub-genre of Industrial Music and more specifically a mending of Industrial Rock and Industrial Metal. An All-star cast including such well known names of the Industrial genre included Paul Barker, Chris Connelly, Jared Louche, Martin Atkins, Steven Seibold, Jim Marcus, Jason Novak, Eric Powell, Curse Mackey among others who performed selections of songs by their bands; Revolting Cocks, 16volt, Chemlab, Acumen Nation, The Damage Manual, Hate Dept., and more that ended with an star studded jam worthy of paying respect to the man that Jamie Duffy was.\n \nThe result of this memorial show proved to be greater than anyone anticipated and it\u2019s scope was even farther reaching than anyone could imagine. Not only did people flock to the Bottom Lounge from all over North America, but also from all corners of the world. But the real effect of this show was greater than simply selling out a 700 person venue, it re-united friends, mended broken relationships and sparked an interest in Industrial music as a whole again. The energy and emotion that was felt on that Friday evening led to new collaborations and new inspirations. Inspiration that in 2013 brought us to the second Cold Waves festival which was expanded to two nights and saw a move to a larger venue, Chicago\u2019s Cabaret Metro. \u201cIndustrial\u201d bands that spanned across multiple genres including Rock, Metal, EBM, Drum n Bass and Punk  descended  upon the city for two emotionally charged shows. The 2013 version of the Cold Waves Festival welcomed the return of CW alumus bands Cocks Members, 16volt, The Clay People, Hate Dept., Iron Lung Corp and Chicago\u2019s favorite radio DJ Zoltar (q101), best known as the \u201cBrother from another Planet\u201d. The rest of the night\u2019s lineups were filled out by the likes of Prong, Nitzer Ebb\u2019s Douglas J. McCarthy (Nitzer Ebb), Die Warzau, Skrew, Evil Mothers, Acucrack,, Bile, Plague Bringer and Fear Factory\u2019s Burton C. Bell made a surprise guest appearance and provided guest vocals alongside many of these artists. \n\n\n\nCOLDWAVE III BANDS:\n\nFRONT 242:\nFront 242\u2019s entire history was clearly defined from the start when Daniel B. and Dirk Bergen released the first single \"Principles\" with the hit song \"Body to Body\u201d in 1981. In 1982, Patrick Codenys - keyboards and Jean-Luc De Meyer - vocals join Front 242 and they release the single \"U-Men\" followed by the first full-length album \"Geography\". This album already displayed the cold, synthetic brand of dance music that would become Front 242\u2019s signature sound in the following years. In 1983, Dirk Bergen left and Richard 23 joined the band as stage performer and vocalist. \n\nThe band created its own label , and the organization which promoted music from Belgium. 1983 saw the release of an EP \u201cEndless Riddance\u201d and the re-release of the first two singles under the title \u201cTwo-In-One\u201d. The band developed and quickly reached a specialised audience in Europe. \n\nWith the second full-length album \u201cNo Comment\u201d in 1984 the term surfaced to describe the synthetic and physically charged qualities of Front 242\u2019s music and sounds recycled from the media and television. \n\nIn 1985, the fabulous \u201cPolitics Of Pressure\u201d was released on 24 track. That year, the band played for the first time in large European festivals and flew to the U.S.A. for some live performances. They were soon tagged as a very powerful live group. \n\nThe international breakthrough came in 1987 following the signing to Wax Trax in the United States and Red Rhino in Europe with the release of the single \u201cInterception\u201d and the albums \u201cBackcatalogue\u201d and \u201cOfficial Version\u201d. This album had a busier sound picture in contrast to the minimalism of the first two studio albums. \n\nIn 1988, Front 242 released the groundbreaking album \"Front by Front\", taking their sound to its logical extreme. Preceded by the dance-club hit single \"Headhunter\" and its prize-winning video directed by Anton Corbijn, \u201cFront By Front\u201d was the band's most streamlined and dance-oriented release, with an index/bpm chart displayed on the sleeve for DJ convenience. This release firmly placed the group as a major driving force of electronic music.\n\nFor their next album release \u201cTyranny >For You<\u201d in 1991, Front 242 was approached by Epic Records U.S. In the next two years Epic did not only release \u201cTyranny >For You<\u201d, but also the entire back catalogue with additional material and new covers. Two different versions of \u201cTragedy >For You<\u201c were lifted from the album. For the first time Front 242 was remixed by other bands: The Orb and Prodigy. The sound of these singles differed somewhat from Front 242's previous releases. The Orb and Prodigy brought a richer and more varied sound.\n\nWhen Front 242 resurfaced at the end of 1993, it was with a radically new sound and two new CD\u2019s \"06:21:03:11 Up Evil\" and \"05:22:09:12 Off\"released within a few months of each other. Front 242 enlisted the services of a number of production people and musicians, giving the sound on both CD\u2019s an extremely rich and layered quality. \u201c06:21:03:11 Up Evil\u201d is the opposite of \"05:22:09:12 Off\"; the two CD\u2019s are based on the duality of good and evil. While \u201c06:21:03:11 Up Evil\u201d utilizes guitars extensively and has a more chaotic sound, \"05:22:09:12 Off\"; is a more melodic CD with female vocals giving the music a sense of beauty that is not normally present in Front 242's music. \n\nIn 1994, Front 242 released \"Live Code\" which was recorded during their last world tour.\n\nThe group's influence from other electronic bands and producers became apparent when Front 242's 1995 release \"Mut@ge.Mix@ge\" featured remixes by Prodigy, The Orb and Underworld. More than just a remix album, all the tracks were reedited in a specific order by Front 242 to provide continuity of enveloping atmospheres and rhythms.\n\nIn 1997, Billboard Encyclopaedia featured Front 242 in their \"Top 500 Best Producers in Rock History\".\n\nAfter a three-year sabbatical, the band decided to undertake a World Tour. Playing live had always been a good way for them to experience excitement and creativity.\n\nIn 1998, Front 242 released \"Re:Boot\", a live album that included new sounds and structures in order to present updated versions of previous Front 242 tracks, once again creating unique sounds and songs.\n\nIn 2003, after a long studio absence, Front 242 released the EP \"Still & Raw\" and the album \"Pulse\". Based on an aesthetic from the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, when German bands influenced the roots of today\u2019s electronic music. Front 242 re-invented the original sound that was at the centre of their art and enriched it by 20 years of experience. Analogue technologies and vintage machines pulsing into deconstructed tracks where emotion and research leads to a purely electronic attitude.\n\nRecent years have seen the members of Front 242 taking a break to pursue various solo projects.\n\n\nFEAR FACTORY:\nFear Factory were one of the first bands to fuse the loud, crushing intensity of death metal with the cold harshness of industrial electronics and samples, producing a more varied sonic palette with which to express their bleak, pessimistic view of modern, technology-driven society. The group was formed in Los Angeles in 1990 by vocalist Burton C. Bell (formerly of Hate Face), percussionist Raymond Herrera, and guitarist and ex-Douche Lord Dino Cazares. Following their contribution of two tracks to the L.A. Death Metal compilation, Fear Factory signed to Roadrunner Records and released their debut album, Soul of a New Machine, in 1992, which featured new bass player Andrew Shives, added to allow Cazares to play guitar on tour. The following year's Fear Is the Mind Killer EP showed Fear Factory's willingness to experiment with their music and broaden its scope by placing tracks from their debut in the hands of remixers Rhys Fulber and Bill Leeb of Front Line Assembly; the EP also marked the debut of keyboardist Reynor Diego, who along with Fulber joined the band as a touring keyboardist. Shives was fired in 1994 and replaced by Christian Olde Wolbers. \n\nIn 1995, Fear Factory released their second full-length album of new material, Demanufacture; it was followed two years later by another remix project, Remanufacture (Cloning Technology), which this time featured contributions from a number of different remixers, including many techno-oriented artists, as well as more input from Fear Factory themselves. Steve Tushar replaced Diego in 1996. The members of the band have performed in a number of side projects, the most notable of which is Cazares' and Herrera's Brujeria; others include G/Z/R (Bell) and Nailbomb (Cazares). Fear Factory reconvened in 1998 for Obsolete, a record that found the band's well-established style fitting seamlessly into the growing alternative metal boom. As such, it became the band's biggest hit yet, hitting the Top 100 on the album charts. Fear Factory's profile was further boosted by appearances on several film soundtracks and on the 1999 Ozzfest tour. Their next album, 2001's Digimortal, entered the charts in the Top 40, but by the next year vocalist Bell decided to leave the band. Cazares was the one who eventually left the band, however, while Wolbers moved to guitar and Byron Stroud (Strapping Young Lad) was hired for the bass spot. \nAmidst the lineup changes, Roadrunner dropped the band and, in 2002, issued their original 1991 recordings on the compilation Concrete. Fear Factory moved to Liquid 8 for 2004's Archetype. The equally merciless Transgression followed in August 2005. Disappointed with Transgression and feeling that they had been pressured into rushing the album out, Fear Factory went on hiatus while the bandmembers pursued other projects. Eventually, Bell and Cazares reconciled their friendship, and in 2009 the pair re-formed Fear Factory with Byron Stroud on bass and Gene Hoglan (who also played with Devin Townsend, Death, and Dethklok, among others) on drums, much to the surprise of Herrera and Wolbers. Now fully operational, Fear Factory began once again manufacturing records, releasing Mechanize in 2010, followed by the concept album The Industrialist in 2012.\n\nDIE KRUPPS:\nDIE KRUPPS - 30 Years of Metall Maschinen Musik\n\nCritics worldwide hail them alongside KRAFTWERK and EINSTUERZENDE NEUBAUTEN as pioneers of Electronic and Industrial music, bands like FRONT 242 and NITZER EBB called them their inspiration, and their musical ideas found their way into the sound of a wide spectrum of music, from DEPECHE MODE to the innovative pioneers of Detroit Techno.\nOver 30 years and many internationally successful albums, DIE KRUPPS have developed an unmistakable signature sound that is meant to stay, which their release 'Als Waeren Wir Fuer Immer' underlines.\n\nAfter monumental and industrial beginnings with the album 'Stahlwerksinfonie', the foundation for Electronic Body Music was laid by the single 'Wahre Arbeit Wahrer Lohn' (both Album and Single Of The Week in the British NME), and the following albums 'Volle Kraft Voraus' and 'Entering The Arena', which created international interest in the band's characteristic synthesis of hard electronics and highly danceable beats. European wide releases secured the band a large following, that was only meant to increase in the '90s.\n\nAfter a three year break, international chart positions of a remake of their classic track 'Wahre Arbeit', now called 'The Machineries Of Joy', which was a collaboration with NITZER EBB (U.S. Billboard Dance Charts Top 10), marked the next chapter in the history of the band. The following widening of their musical spectrum, which saw the addition of a more Metal inspired aggressive vocal style and guitar riffs on the album 'I', and the essential single track 'Metal Machine Music', was like a slap in the face of conservative critics and listeners alike. The mini album 'A Tribute To Metallica' underlined this daring step, gaining the attention of Lars Ulrich and Co., who helped to secure the band a deal in the U.S.\n\nThe highly successful albums (european-wide Chart positions, Germany Top-20) 'II - The Final Option', 'The Final Remixes', which consisted of remix interpretations of DIE KRUPPS tracks by fellow bands such as NINE INCH NAILS, THE SISTERS OF MERCY, FAITH NO MORE, CLAWFINGER and many others, and the album ..III - Odyssey Of The Mind, were again inspiration to many upcoming new bands, such as RAMMSTEIN, whose song 'Tier' was a direct adaptation and tribute to DIE KRUPPS 'The Dawning Of Doom' from the album 'I'.\n\nAfter several worldwide tours, and another Chart-topping album, 'Paradise Now' (Germany No.17), on which the band collaborated with Arthur Brown ('Fire'), it was decided to bring a temporary stop to the bands extraordinary career.\n\n2005 marked the 25th anniversary of DIE KRUPPS, which was reason enough for the two original members Engler and Doerper to prove to the rest of the world that DIE KRUPPS are far from being dead. The reunited group played festivals across Europe and proved that their live shows are as energetic as ever. The audience response was overwhelming and proved that the band had not lost any ground during its absence.\n\nIn November 2007, DIE KRUPPS\u2019 new album 'Too Much History' was released. The album included re-recordings of the greatest hits from almost every album the band had released in the past, plus several unreleased new tracks, including 'The Great Divide', '5 Millionen' and several collaborations, with Client B from the band CLIENT, and again Douglas McCarthy from NITZER EBB.\n\nThe end of 2008 saw the release of a remix album of the 1982 album 'Volle Kraft voraus', entitled 'Volle Kraft Null Acht'. KMFDM, FUNKER VOGT, PROJECT PITCHFORK, LEAETHERSTRIP, SPETSNAZ and MODULATE are only a few acts who besides many others contributed to the project. The two singles 'Volle Kraft Voraus' and 'Ende Der Traeume' topped the German Alternative Charts for weeks.\n\nIn 2010 the mini-abum 'Als Waeren Wir Fuer Immer', consisting of all new material, hit the strores. It also stayed in top positions of the Deutsche Alternative Charts for many weeks, and re-entered during the NITZER EBB / DIE KRUPPS European tour in April of 2011. The tour, which was launched under the motto 'Join In The Rhythm Of Machines', was a huge success. A joint NITZER EBB / DIE KRUPPS EP, consiting of re-worked versions of each band's favorite songs, was sold exclusively at the shows. Those songs were also played live, followed by the definite highlight for many fans, the anthemic 'Machineries Of Joy', which saw both bands perform the song together for the first time.\n\nAt the end of 2012, the first single from the upcoming album 'The Machinists of Joy' was released. 'Risikofaktor' made it No.1 in the German DAC Charts again, and stayed in the pole position for a full month.\n\n2013 was to become the year when DIE KRUPPS machinery went back into full swing. The machines were greased, the dust shaken off, the factory gates opened again. After shift operation was restored, the long-awaited new prototype 'The Machinists Of Joy' rolled off the assembly line on 25.10.2013. With this most recent effort DIE KRUPPS seamlessly pick up the streak of their genre-defining releases in the '80s and '90s. DIE KRUPPS still deliver 'Metal MACHINE Music' - heavy, danceable, sometimes epic machine-music, adorned with well-placed guitar attacks and the ever-onward hammering of the 'steel-o-phone', paired with critical contemporary lyrics, setting themselves off from what has become the norm today.\n\nReferring to their top-10 Billboard-hit from 1989 'Machineries Of Joy', the album title already hints at a stronger focus on electronic sounds, rather than guitars, which dominates the current outfit of DIE KRUPPS. However, resolute riffs have been worked into the songs very pointedly. The album also makes it No.1 in the German DAC Charts, where it is currently holding the pole position again for the second consecutive week. The second single of the album 'Schmutzfabrik' peaks at No.2, and staying there for 7 weeks.\n\nFrom mid-February 2014 the factory bell rings in the nightshift on European stages, to be known as 'THE MACHINISTS OF JOY'-TOUR 2014. 12 dates have been scheduled on which DIE KRUPPS are going to present their first studio album of the new millennium in sweat-inducing manner! Full speed ahead!\n\nCOCKSURE:\nChristopher J. Connelly and Jason C. Novak bridge the gap between waxtrax! era industrial and the future sounds of mass corruption. Full-length LP coming summer 2014.\nTHE SOUND: huge air-craft hangar size mechanized rhythms and bone-crushing, limb-severing noises that stretch from 2014 all the way back to 1985, long, endurance testing, panic-attack hit songs that you can drive around at night to, sweating dry-ice and smoking your chemical-weapon blunts.\nTHE WORDS: shockingly infantile, irreverent & irrelevant, riot inciting, anger inducing, anti-social, unashamedly un-p.c. , paranoid, narcissistic bullshit, barked and howled by someone who you think would have learned his fucking lesson by now.\nTHE PERPS: COCKSURE-the bastard that once was \u201cREVCO\u201d deformed and dug up, \nre-animated and re-branded by CHRIS CONNELLY and JASON NOVAK .\u201dUnfinished bizness\u201d mutters Chris under his breath with a chuckle, then politely folding his arms and crossing his legs he whispers softly: \u201cWe\u2019ll show these pussy-ass motherfuckers how it\u2019s really done\u201d adding with a serene smile \u201cwe\u2019ll tell these ageing dinosaur fuckwads where to stick their dicks\u201d\n\nTHE CHARGES: car jacking, drug dealing, pyromania (adoration of), credit card fraud, brawling, shoplifting & petty theft, chronic serial infidelity, slutism, weapon smuggling, online porn addiction, drinking binges, coke binges, speed binges, binge binges, auto theft, porn skyping, messianic behavior, trans gender hookers (pathetic attempts to \u201cengage\u201d with) hookers (pathetic attempts to \u201cengage\u201d with), solvent abuse, and botched plastic surgery (laughing at the expense of).\nTHE OUTCRY: \u201cthese people are despicable, truly society\u2019s day-old used q-tips, we thought we were DONE with this childish self obsessed crap and we were safely tucked away in middle age doing respectable soundtracks or appearing in the reality shows of the poorly-tatooed: but NO! these HALFWITS are here to PICK us up by the scruffs of our necks and drop us like used condoms on the dancefloor .SHUT DOWN THE CLUBS!! RUN THAT D.J. OUT OF TOWN & HURRY BACK TO YOUR SAFE POP/PUNK PANIC ROOM.\nYOUTH CODE:\nLos Angeles Duo Youth Code are raw, punishing, industrious electronics built from the seeds of hardcore and early Wax Trax. Ryan William George and Sara Taylor blend chaos with catchy dance undertones to create a sonic fury paralleled to none. Formed in 2012, Using all hardware to perform, Youth Code have already proven their path with being the first band outside of Psychic TV to be put out by PTV's own label \" Angry Love Productions \" as well as a full length LP on the flawless Dais Records roster. On Tour Now!\nACUMEN NATION:\nACUMEN NATION:\nFormed in the late 1980s as Acumen by Jason Novak and Ethan Novak , the band released several cassette demos before self-releasing the CD demo \u201cTransmissions from Eville\u201d in 1994. The two along with Greg Lopez put the record out themselves on the infamous Robot Records moniker. During shows for this period, the band added guitarist/engineer Jamie Duffy. \n\nAlthough the glory days of the Industrial rock scene in Chicago had faded by this point, through constant touring and sheer hard work on a number of different projects the duo have since established themselves as favorites in the US underground scene. The Iron Lung Corp. was a band composed of Acumen and The Clay People from Albany, NY. Their first record, \u201996s \u201cBig Shiny Spears\u201d featured covers of Nitzer Ebb\u2019s seminal dance hits \u2018Join in the Chant\u2019 and \u2018Murderous.\u2019 \n\nIn 1997, the band were forced to change their name due to a legal dispute with a preexisting progressive rock band also called Acumen. The band split their project into two halves - the drum and bass influenced DJ? Acucrack, and the more traditional rock format of Acumen Nation. Tours for both projects followed. In 1998, Greg Lopez left the band to pursue other interests. He was replaced by Eric Alvarez, also known as the bar. The four recorded 2000\u2019s Strike 4. Eric exited the band before the record was released and was replaced by Eliot Engelman. \n\nThe close of 2001 saw the release of \u201cLive Farewell 2001,\u201d which was to signify a hiatus for the band as the recording marked the final performance of Ethan Novak with the band, who left to form the band Cordy. He was replaced by Dan Brill who currently plays with the band. \n\nEliot Engelman left the band following the release of Anticore in 2006 and the following tour with Front Line Assembly in mid-2007. Ethan Novak returned to play live bass during the \u201cPsychoTransHumanoid\u201d tour of the west coast with Cyanotic, promoting the simultaneous release of Acumen Nation\u2019s Psycho the Rapist and DJ? Acucrack\u2019s Humanoids from the Deep and Cyanotic\u2019s Transhuman 2.0.\nAUTHOR AND PUNISHER:\nAuthor & Punisher hs released 5 albums over a period of 10 years.  The first two albums: THE PAINTED ARMY and WARCRY (EP) were self released and recorded by Tristan while he was in art school at the University of California, San Diego studying sculpture.  During this time he designed and built what would become his master\u2019s thesis project, the DRONE MACHINES, which would become the name of the third album, later released by Heart & Crossbone out of Tel-Aviv, Israel.  DRONE MACHINES is probably the heaviest of the A&P albums and also the longest at around 70 minutes.  This album is definitely is motherfucker with most of the tracks written and droned out on the DRONE MACHINES themselves.   After graduating, Tristan began touring extensively, which forced him to design a new set of lighter more dynamic instruments, called the Dub Machines.  These machines spawned a new album called URSUS AMERICANUS in 2012  released on CD, digital and viyl, this marked the first release with Seventh Rule Recordings out of Portland, OR, a doom metal and industrial juggernaut of a label.  Unlike the previous album, URSUS AMERICANUS was written and played entirely on these machines.  At about 45 minutes, this is an intense jarring album with the most notable track being Terrorbird (see the video here).  Throughout the process of touring, more songs were written and other more traditional instruments were added to the mix giving birth to WOMEN & CHILDREN in 2013, also released on Seventh Rule on all mediums.  Expect new material from Author & Punisher every year in different capacities.\nIconoclastic in the truest sense of the word, Tristan Shone inverts the tenets of doom metal completely, relying on cold steel and soulless machinery to sonically replicate the despondency of life. Described most succinctly as \u201cindustrial doom,\u201d this one-man project utilizes primarily custom designed and fabricated machines and speakers. From Shone\u2019s background and current position as a mechanical engineer, his designs and devices draw heavily on aspects of industrial automation and robotics with also a focus upon the eroticism of interaction with machine. The machines are designed to require significant force from the performer, aligning he/she with the plodding doom-influenced sounds that are created.\n\u2206AIMON:\n\u2206AIMON is a male/female duo working within the electronic genre to produce atmospheric compositions built upon dark and occult aesthetics. Dense and weighed heavily by a bleak and oddly romantic sentiment.\nBiography\n\u2206AIMON are an American dark electronic duo from San Diego, CA. They are one of the early adopters of the witch-house title but are generally considered cross-genre, utilising strong influences from industrial, no-wave, trip-hop, and experimental music.\n\nHaving formed late July of 2010, husband and wife team Brant and Nancy Showers came to the early attention of witch-house fans through their first songs made public on SoundCloud (\u2018amen\u2019 and a cover of the SWANS\u2019 song, \u2018A SCREW\u2019). This attention gained them the release of their first EP, amen, on the Bay Area experimental electronic label Tundra Dubs in February of 2011. Their extensive amount of remix work within the dark electronic community helped maintain a loyal fan base and an active role in the underground electronic scenes. Their follow-up EP, FLATLINER, was released on vinyl through Tundra Dubs in April of 2012 and as an expanded CD edition through the Canadian label, Artoffact Records in November of the same year. Both editions received critical acclaim and are were widely praised in the dark electronic/witch-house scene as well as more contemporary industrial and goth related circles.\n\nWith FLATLINER defying genres and bridging the gap between the indie and traditional industrial genres, \u2206AIMON continued to grow a larger following, shedding much of their earlier mystique in order to interact directly with fans and peers. This new transparency formed the foundation of their first full length album (self-titled) released December 3rd, 2013 through Artoffact Records. The \u2206AIMON album, built-upon live show experiences and an interest in expressing their anxieties and emotions much more directly, once again received an impressive response from media and fans.\n\n\u2206AIMON has remained active on social networks, retaining a close interaction with fans and the dark electronic community. With the recent release of their album, \u2206AIMON has expressed interest in expanding their live shows as well as developing more art-related concepts.\n\nSOUNDS OF MASS PRODUCTION (SMP):\nSMP, aka Sounds of Mass Production, is an American industrial-rock band, with heavy rap and punk influences. The band was founded by Jason Bazinet and Sean Ivy and the pair debuted in 1995 with their acclaimed break-out record, \"Stalemate.\" After the debut record, Bazinet continued on with SMP as its main songwriter, programmer, auxiliary drummer and vocalist. \n\nSMP has recently inked a deal with Chicago-based WTII Records and is working on an album now. Veteran producer Wade Alin has been tapped to produce and mix the album, and Mike Ostrander of the band 64K is on board programming and writing with Bazinet.\n\nSMP's previous six releases are \"Coda\" (2010), \"The Treatment\" (2007), \"Crimes of the Future\" (2004), \"Terminal\" (2000), \"Ultimatum\" (1998) and \"Stalemate\" (1995).\n\nThree remix albums have been released as well: \"Shot\" (2011), \"Pissing on the Legacy\" (2008) and \"Hacked\" (2001).\n\nSMP's live shows are an amalgamation of the physical and the electronic. Furious drumming, biting guitars and raw vocals are coupled with the cold chaos of the machine.\n\nThe current live make-up of the band is Jason Bazinet (vocals/ aux. drums), Dan Miura (guitar) and Juan Gomez (drums) with Galen Waling occasionally subbing on drums.\n\nCAUSTIC:\nCaustic was created in 2002 by Madison, Wisconsin\u2019s Matt Fanale. Like \u201cTrent Reznor is Nine Inch Nails,\u201d Matt Fanale is Caustic.\nCaustic live consists of a rotating band of freaks, depending on the city, but Caustic\u2019s main line-up consists of Brian/darkNES and Katja/DJ :EYG of THE GOTHSICLES, and Eric Gottesman of EVERYTHING GOES COLD.\nCaustic has performed over the years with dozens, if not zillions, of other artists/bands, including ATARI TEENAGE RIOT, MY LIFE WITH THE THRILL KILL KULT, COMBICHRIST, KMFDM, THIS MORN\u2019 OMINA, GRENDEL, GOD MODULE, APOPTYGMA BERZERK, FADERHEAD and many, many more. He\u2019s also done dozens of remixes.\nFanale is also in more side projects than he has any right to be, including PRUDE (with Jared Louche of CHEMLAB, amongst others), PARASITE TWIN with Brian Schuh, and THE CAUSTICLES with Brian of The Gothsicles.\n\n\nSURACHAI:\nFathme Records plague metal artist Surachai has been clearing dance floors for years leaving only true worshippers of metal. Spitting out non-time signatures, melting faces off with disjointed blast beats and relying heavily on modular synthesizers to cave in chests, Surachai has been mending it\u2019s own cathartic path. Surachai currently runs the infamous Trash_Audio blog and shade:red record label with Justin McGrath.\n\n\nCYANOTIC:\nCyanotic defines aggressive electronic rock, melding elements of metal, electro and drum 'n' bass to create a unique sonic assault. Breaking down the barriers between guitar and electronic genres.\nThe band's fan base is rapidly growing, thanks to word of mouth and memorable performances alongside bands like Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Meat Beat Manifesto, 16 Volt, Chemlab, Andrew W.K., Stromkern, Acumen Nation, DJ? Acucrack and many more.\nCyanotic and Glitch Mode Recordings [the group's affiliation] began in the early 2000s. Sean Payne [vocals/electronics] and Drew Rosander [guitars/synths] were learning to make music with computers and guitars, partying in empty houses, growing up around the rave scene in Chicago, basement punk shows in Indiana and drug excess all through the midwest.\nIn 2003, \"Mutual Bonding Through Violation\" was released through Cyanotic's own Glitch Mode Records to coincide with the band's first US tour. Chris Hryniewiecki [guitars] became a member later that same year. \"MBTV\" is now out of print.\n\"MBTV\" set the tone for what fans could expect from Cyanotic. Great reviews and various shows, including a US tour lead to the release of \"Transhuman\" in 2005. This was Cyanotic's first full length album. Relentless touring of the US and Canada sold this album out in August of 2006. \nCyanotic delivered \"Transhuman 2.0\" to the public in July 2007 via Bit Riot Records and WTII Records. The limited 2-disc deluxe edition features the original \"Transhuman\", as well new songs, alternate mixes, bonus tracks and guest appearances from members of Front Line Assembly, 16 Volt, Acumen Nation, DJ? Acucrack, mindfluxFuneral and Rabbit Junk. Bit Riot Records has begun the single pressing of \"T.2\", reporting that the limited edition will soon be out of print. \nOne of the most talked about albums from Cyanotic is without a doubt \"The Medication Generation\". The anticipation of this album lead the band to the unleashing of the limited \"Prehab 25mg-EP\", which will serve as a much needed wake up call to the masses. Prehab 25mg is the hard hitting precursor to \"The Medication Generation\", a futuristic audio assault exploring the excess of self-medication and mass media saturation in present day society. This is a definitive soundtrack to a dystopian world view.\n\"The Medication Generation\" is currently in production and set for release in Summer 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\nZOLTAR - The Brother from Another Planet\n\nFrom San Diego to Shanghai, the world-famous DJ known as Zoltar has been a major force on American and International radio as well as a consistent club DJ throughout the United States and Europe. Prior to Zoltar's unmistakable voice finding worldwide recognition, he had already become a seasoned traveler seeing the world as part of the U.S. Military A creative and profound communicator, Zoltar found a home at the legendary FM radio station, 91X in San Diego, California where he hosted a groundbreaking specialty show called \u2018Shrapnel\u2019, which fused Rap and Metal. His passion for emerging talent in many forms of music led to his hosting \u2018Fast Forward\u2019. His rise in American FM radio had Zoltar crossing the country to Washington DC, where he created a Techno/Industrial dance show called the \u2018Mutant Dance Party\u2019 for CBS' legendary WHFS. Still hosting the \u2018Mutant Dance Party\u2019 in Washington DC, Zoltar was brought to Chicago where he began a hardcore Industrial show called \u2018The Industrial Zone\u2019. During that period Zoltar also turned up the heat in Florida with the creation of a full on metal show called \u2018The X Factor\u2019.\n\nZoltar\u2019s meteoric rise in terrestrial radio led to the next evolutionary step in his career: Satellite Radio. As Program Director of the global dance channel \u2018The System\u2019 which was heard in 134 countries via the Worldspace Satellite Radio Network and across North America on XM, Zoltar has been the voice and personality to bring the planet live reports on performances from the Winter Music Conference and Ultra Music festival in Miami, Amsterdam\u2019s Dance Valley, Global Gathering Music Festivals, Lollapalooza, and The Virgin Mobile Festival. His creation of the weekly Trance/Progressive show called \u2018Subterranean\u2019 was added to the satellite radio roster and fast became an international hit with syndication to terrestrial radio around the world. Affiliates of the \u2018Planet Zoltar Broadcast Network\u2019 include The Sirius/XM channel, Area (Sirius 38/XM80), FM 89.7 The River, Omaha Nebraska, 104.7 FM Radio Safari Ioannina Greece, 97. 6 Radio Flash FM, Targu Neamt Romania, Global Radio FM in Miami, intenet-based stations trancebase.fm (Germany), danceradio.gr (Greece), Ascenddanceradio.com in South Florida and DirecTV. Zoltar is also the head of A&R for Hardwire Records and is also a producer and remixer. Currently his base of operations is Panama City Beach in sunny Florida where his world-famous show, \u2018Subterranean\u2019 is recorded. One of the most popular syndicated shows available on the airwaves and over the internet, Subterranean has 491 shows.\n\n\nCRACKNATION:\n\nCracknation is the label founded by Jason Novak to house the many projects he and his cohorts were involved in creating, from Acumen Nation and DJ? Acucrack to Iron Lung Corp, Fawn and Czar. Spanning a decade and over 20 releases, the label continues to evolve as evidenced by the Cold Waves festival and pending releases from Iron Lung, Acucrack and Czar (who will be supporting Killing Joke this month on their North American Tour).\n\nA recently completed documentary entitled \"Rally and Sustain\" covers the umbrella of members and projects over the last 22 years, and is now available on DVD and download.",

Solotroff is also known as the vocalist in the doom/shoegaze band Anatomy of Habit. In The Fortieth Day, Reyes and Solotroff utilize guitar, bass, drum machine, and analog synthesizer to create epic, blackened, psychedelic-industrial drone soundscapes, likened to \"sustained, withering blasts of high-pitched noise that are as distinct from one another as spotlights sweeping across the night sky; jackhammer clatter, jet-engine whines, and forlorn keyboard melodies dart in and out of those huge sounds with the grace and impunity of plovers picking a crocodile's teeth\" [Bill Meyer, Chicago Reader]\nAs always for their live performances, the duo will be joined by video artist Lisa Slodki, performing under her Noise Crush moniker. Slodki is is also known for her exhibition and performance series with Chicago trio, Haptic, held at the UBS 12 x 12 Gallery in the Museum of Contemporary Art. Slodki utilizes a battery of VCRs and small video monitors, along with a video mixer and a projector, to present a seamless flow of black and white, primarily abstract, manipulated and looped found footage, resulting in a visual program that emphasizes subtle emotions and gestures and that perfectly compliments the music performed by The Fortieth Day.\n\nBRUCE LAMONT\nBruce Lamont joined Yakuza in February of 2000 and since the group has recorded four full lengths including their latest release \"transmutations.\" In July of 2006 he made his debut solo performance using a looper pedal and effects along with saxophones, guitar, voice, harp, and percussion.",

Originally serving meals a few days per week, the Community Kitchen now serves hot meals 365 days a year with the help of more than 40 partnering organizations and nearly 10,000 volunteer hours. Last year alone, the Community Kitchen served more than 54,000 meals.\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\nVolunteers must wear pants and closed toed shoes. Volunteers will be handling hot food and beverages; dressing accordingly will help protect volunteers against burns or other accidents.\n\nCOST:\nFree! Please reserve a free ticket for one of 10 available volunteer spots:\nhttp://tap-community-kitchen.eventbrite.com\n\n\nTRANSPORTATION:\nAmple street parking ($1/hr parking meter applies)\nHoward station on the CTA Red Line.

Which means every 100 or so tickets I sell, I will be placing an order with the White Sox for these tickets. \nSo as a warning, you may have to wait a month before i can get your tickets sent out to you. \n-I can take cash, money order, moneygram, or paypal for payment. Will also charge standard rate of shipping to ship them back to you. \n-NO REFUNDS\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS, I CAN GET YOU IN TOUCH WITH MY WHITE SOX REP.",

N\u00e5 er de klare for GT Bluesklubb!\n\u25ba En felles interesse for den gode, gamle Chicago-bluesen f\u00f8rte dette bandet sammen i 1996. Repertoaret speiler utviklingen fra akustisk deltablues til elektrisk \u201dstorbyjungel\u201d. Med CDen \u201dRockin\u2019 Feet\u201d (1998) viste bandet at det heller ikke skorter p\u00e5 originalitet og eget l\u00e5tmateriale. Chicago Bound leverer varene r\u00e5tt, svingende og bl\u00e5tt. Bandnavnet har de for \u00f8vrig l\u00e5nt fra en Jimmy Rogers l\u00e5t fra 50-tallet.\n\u25ba Vokalist og bassist Frode Larsen har fartstid fra bluesbandet Larsen\u2019s Last Chance og har de senere \u00e5rene hovedsakelig spilt i Patey\u2019s Pipe, samt en del freelance-jobbing. Under eget navn har han gitt ut platene: \u201dJukeboxman\u201d(2002) og \u201dHard Luck And Trouble\u201d(2007).\n\u25ba Kurt Slevingen er en intens og s\u00e6rdeles sjelfull gitarist. Han er i besittelse av solide kunnskaper om de forskjellige blues-stilartene og gir alt n\u00e5r han st\u00e5r p\u00e5 scenen. Han startet bandet Blue Soul i Bergen p\u00e5 80-tallet, og litt senere begynte samarbeidet med munnspiller Eirek Sandnes i Bluebirds og Oslo Bluesband, f\u00f8r Chicago Bound oppsto i 1996. Debutskiva, \u201dWest Side From The East Side\u201d, kom i 2002.\n\u25ba Raufossingen Eirek Sandnes er en veteran i milj\u00f8et og anses av mange \u00e5 v\u00e6re Norges fremste bluesmunnspiller. Denne mannen er en virtuoso p\u00e5 sitt instrument og har bl\u00e5st bl\u00e5toner i band som Vidar Busk , Knut Reiersrud Band , Sunnyland Slim, Sven Zetterberg , Jaybirds, Sugar Daddies, Little Itch og Oslo Bluesband. Samtidig som han er en suveren eksponent for munnspill-tradisjonen til Little Walter Jacobs/Kim Wilson, behersker han ogs\u00e5 til fulle et mer akustisk sound ala Sonny Boy Williamson II.\n\u25ba Espen A. Moen har gjennom mange \u00e5rs turnering med et utall av artister og band, etablert seg som en av Norges mest etterspurte blues-trommiser. Listen over freelance-oppdrag er lang, og han er ogs\u00e5 fast medlem av Tiger City Jukes og Eagle Ridin\u2019 Papas.",

        "description": "This August Justin and Chris return to the windy city for some mid-western therapeutic bliss. Give your body and being the gift of learning to give and receive, immersed in the world of yoga, flying therapeutics, Thai massage and other bodywork modalities. Harness the power of gravity and explore new freedoms in three-dimensional healing touch. Relax into the rejuvenating power of supportive community... Come fly with us!\n\nThis immersion teaches valuable tools for yoga teachers, massage therapists and physical therapists who want to develop their capacity to heal using their hands, and fulfills one of the prerequisites for the AcroYoga Teacher Training. This event also qualifies for 30 contact hours as part of the One Yoga USA TT and Yoga 4 Love Advanced Trainings; a certificate of completion will be given at the end of the 5 days. No previous experience or partner necessary. This training is for everybody; you do not have to be a yogi or have practiced acro.\n\nTo Register: \nhttp://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ws.asp?studioid=520&stype=-101&sView=day&sTrn=100000074\n\nQuestions: chris@acroyoga.org, 570.460.6824\n\nLocation:\n3113 North Lincoln Avenue Chicago, IL 60657\n\nInvestment:\nFull 5 days Early-Bird until July 23rd: $435\nFull 5 days from July 24th on: $535\nSaturday only day rate: $108\n\nSchedule:\nSat - Wed 10am - 5:30pm\n\nWhat is AcroYoga?\nAcroYoga blends the wisdom of yoga, the dynamic power of acrobatics, and the loving kindness of healing arts. These three lineages form the foundation of a practice that cultivates trust, playfulness, and community. In this immersion we will focus on the Lunar Healing Arts Practices that cultivate listening, loving and letting go and Yogic Practices that cultivate breathe awareness, life balance and connection.\n\nAcroYoga is a space to:\n\n- Heal the body\n- Learn to massage both on the floor and in the air\n- Play with freedom\n- Connect profoundly both with both yourself and with friends\n- Break the barriers of what you believe impossible\n- Conquer gravity\n- Take off in flight\n- Join the world community of AcroYoga\n\u2026 and smile a ton!\n\n\nAbout Justin Caruso:\nJustin feels the body to be a reflection of life: an ecstatic temple, a work of art, and a vehicle for connection. Just before the financial crisis Justin made a timely exit from Wall Street to return to yoga, a practice he began over fifteen years ago. A New York native, Justin has spent the past seven years traveling extensively through South America, Asia and the US, teaching and studying yoga, AcroYoga, bodywork and water therapies with many of the world's master teachers of the healing arts.\n\nAbout Chris Loebsack:\nChris Loebsack 500hr E-RYT uses the power of yoga to create space for students that cultivates trust playfulness and connection within themselves and their communities. Living by her mantra, Clarity, Integrity and Love, she draws upon her AcroYoga Practice to share the healing power of touch and safe intimacy. She is a valuable mentor to many upcoming educators. \n\nTestimonials:\n\n\"Thank you for such an incredible experience you just facilitated. You are gifted teachers, really. The material was presented with such ease; in an accessible, thorough, as well as FUN way! The healing that came from Thai Massage ( every morning ), and the playful laughter from flight; I truly feel nourished, inspired, and transformed. My deepest gratitude.\"\n\n\"Thank YOU for passing on and spreading your beautiful loving Energy. I missed going to the immersion this morning. Even though i went back to the same routine as before, today was a different day. Eternally grateful for having the opportunity to be your student for a few days.\nMany more will come. Muchas bendiciones y mucho amor\"\n\n\"Still riding so high on the waves of love shared at the lunar immersion in Miami! I am left with so many images from that weekend that make me weep from the pure beauty and loving that was embodied so perfectly in yourself, Chris, Ari and Lau! You've touched me profoundly and inspired me deeply! HUGE gratitude...thank you!\"\n\n\"I am singing praises for the connectedness and receptivity that I was blessed to experience this past week. Weaving threads of trust and surrender into one mandala of supreme symmetry, balance, and love. Learning how to allow my inner light to sink deeper into a space that homes boundless expansion. If we can move with ease and grace in our lives with an open accepting unconditional love for ourselves, only then can we truly give love to others. I am a conduit of radiance that is open to shine and was born to shine. Thank you from the bottom of my heart Chris Loebsack and Justin Caruso for awakening these gems of wisdom within me. I will never forgot our Lunar Immersion together and the beautiful sangha that was created. Endless gratitude to the divine healing in AcroYoga\"\n\n\n\"Last year, when I saw the amazing cast of great teachers that was going to teach this immersion I decided wholeheartedly to dive in. I rest reassured that that was one of the best ways to start 2013. I'm deeply inspired by where you have taken your practice (and where it has taken you) and feel grateful for how generous is your desire to share it. As it is with those souls that inject one's life with the substance of spiritual growth, I rest comfortably assured that there will be more opportunities for sharing the same space and share some love.\"\n\n\"Justiiiiiiiiin GRACIASSSS! THANK YOUUU! It was a truly amazing experience. I joined the Lunar Immersion to put myself outside of my comfort zone. At first I thought I was just going to be a spectator not having any experience but your teaching techniques were flawless and I very quickly felt like I was part of it all. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the aspect of giving in Acro Yoga I had a very big need to channel my need to give in a loving and nurturing way. Receiving was too much to handle! (No words to describe) The whole experience filled me with a renewed energy. My students have not stoped commenting that I look so happy. It was such a great investment. I still don't have the confidence to fly them or try any of the techniques but I do have my 6 yr old daughter and she is my little person to practice with. I still have to keep learning so for now I will continue to study as much Acro yoga as I can. Thank you for coming to Puerto Rico, for being such a great instructor, for sharing your light and for doing what you do. I wish you a whole lot of goodness!!!! I hope our paths cross again soon Big Hug\"",

        "description": "Very Special Guest\" Piano Schulze \"\nManne Chicago\nVideo ansehen http://www.myvideo.de/watch/9236699/Manne_Chicago_2\nSeit \u00fcber 50 Jahren spielt er mit Leidenschaft und Herzblut Blues und Boogie Woogie am Piano und gilt nicht nur in Berlin als Legende.\nAlles begann mit dem Film \"Swing Serenade\", den er Mitte der 50er Jahre in einem Berliner Kino sah - mit Auftritten von Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, Jack Teagarden und vielen anderen mehr, was ihn begeisterte, - doch es gab noch etwas anderes, das ihn wie er sagt geradezu \"elektrisierte\": und das waren in den Pausen zwischen den gezeigten Big Band-Auftritten  Zeichentrickcartoons, die musikalisch untermalt waren mit den Boogie Woogies von Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis und Pete Johnson, und zwar in einer selbst f\u00fcr heutige Verh\u00e4ltnisse erstaunlich klaren Tonqualit\u00e4t.\nSchellack- und Vinyl-Platten in diesem Bereich waren rar, immerhin konnte er Pinetop Smiths Boogie Woogie und eine EP mit den Aufnahmen von Albert Ammons Rhythm Kings erwerben. \u00dcber England gelangte er an Platten im fr\u00fchen Barrelhouse Stil, einer rustikalen Art des Kneipenboogies, die seine Spielweise ma\u00dfgeblich mitgepr\u00e4gt hat, was sich vor allem in \u00fcberf\u00fcllten Berliner Kneipen immer wieder als Vorteil erwiesen hat.Da es weder Klavierlehrer gab, die den Stil beherrschten, noch brauchbare Klavier-Noten, h\u00f6rte er mit einem alten UHER-Tonband, das er auf halbe Geschwindigkeit stellte, Piano Solos heraus. Eine Technik, die von vielen Pianisten in abgewandelter Form bis heute praktiziert wird.\nUnser Preistr\u00e4ger ist der einzige Boogiepianist, der einen der gro\u00dfen Drei, n\u00e4mlich Pete Johnson noch live erleben durfte, Ende der 50er Jahre im Rahmen der Konzertreihe Norman Granz' Jazz At The Philharmonic im Berliner Sportpalast. In ebendieser Zeit gr\u00fcndete unser Preistr\u00e4ger ein Trio mit Bass- und Schlagzeugbegleitung unter dem Namen \"The Boogie Woogie Prayers\", ferner spielte er als Mitglied der Formation Hans&Co.\nDer Rundfunk entdeckte ihn f\u00fcr die Sendungen SFBeat des Sender Freies Berlin und Club 18 des RIAS Berlin.\nGleich nach der Grenz\u00f6ffnung unternahm er mit dem Gitarristen Gunther Schulze sowie Schlagzeugbegleitung, ausgedehnte Tourneen in die Neuen Bundesl\u00e4nder.  Dort begr\u00fc\u00dften ihn die Konzertbesucher begeistert und sagten: \"Endlich erleben wir dich mal live, wir haben dich fr\u00fcher immer im Radio geh\u00f6rt!\"\nEs w\u00e4re m\u00fc\u00dfig aufzuz\u00e4hlen, wo er \u00fcberall gespielt hat, - in kleinen und gro\u00dfen Kneipen, z.B. 2-3 die Woche \u00fcber Jahre regelm\u00e4\u00dfig in der Ostberliner 88-Kneipe,  aber auch in Konzerts\u00e4len, auf privaten Feiern, oder zuletzt beim gro\u00dfen Festival der Hamburger Boogie Connection in der Fabrik.\nIch durfte ihn Mitte der 80er Jahre in Berlin kennen- und sch\u00e4tzen lernen, als Musiker und jemanden, der f\u00fcr andere Pianisten eine Anlaufstelle war, jemand, der immer ein freundliches und best\u00e4rkendes Wort \u00fcbrig hatte f\u00fcr die, die sich selbst am Klavier ausprobierten. Und auch heute noch mit 74 Jahren gibt er gerne die Begeisterung f\u00fcr den Boogie in Form von Klavierunterricht weiter.\n\nMitte der 80er spielte sich die West-Berliner Boogie Szene vorwiegend im Bermuda-Dreieck der Lokale Blues Caf\u00e9, Jazz For Fun und dem Yorkschl\u00f6sschen ab, wovon heute leider nur noch das Yorkschl\u00f6sschen \u00fcbrig geblieben ist. Daf\u00fcr gibt es heute andere Auftrittsgelegenheiten. Aber gerne erinnere ich mich noch an die Konzerte damals, die nicht vor 22 Uhr anfingen und um 3 Uhr auch noch nicht zu Ende waren, mit unserem Preistr\u00e4ger in vorderster Linie.\nAls Haupttonarten des Boogie Woogie gelten C-Dur, F-Dur, G-Dur. Und wie Sie alle wissen, ist der pr\u00e4gnante Grundtonanschlag in der linken Hand ein unverzichtbarer Bestandteil des Boogies. Das tiefe C ist in allen drei Tonarten wichtig. Als Tonika in C-Dur, als Dominante in F-Dur und in G-Dur als Subdominante. Was aber, wenn ausgerechnet dieser Ton kaputt, also klanglos ist, weil ein Betrunkener Bier ins Piano gesch\u00fcttet hat? Ein Fiasko f\u00fcr viele, aber kein Problem f\u00fcr unseren Preistr\u00e4ger, der auch in den abwegigsten Tonarten wie H-Dur, E-Dur und A-Dur heimisch ist.\nEinmal, so schildert er, schaute ihm ein anderer Pianist auf die Tasten und sagte emp\u00f6rt: \"H-Dur? In der Tonart spielt man nicht!\" - worauf unser Preistr\u00e4ger entgegnete: \"Was hei\u00dft hier, in der Tonart spielt MAN nicht. DU kannst das nicht spielen, MAN kann das schon, wie Du siehst.\" Ja, man kann und das hei\u00dft genauer gesagt: MANNE kann! Wir w\u00fcrdigen ihn heute in der Kategorie Besondere Verdienste um den Boogie Woogie, aus der Bundeshauptstadt Berlin:\n\nMANNE CHICAGO!\n\nLaudatio gehalten von Jo Schumacher",

Logan Boulevard) in Chicago. The double-header kicks off with The Outfit\u2019s Shade Brigade vs. the Twin City Travelers (B) at 7:00pm, and the excitement keeps rolling with The Outfit\u2019s Syndicate vs. the Twin City Travelers (A).\n\nTickets can be purchased online for $15 at www.chicagooutfitrollerderby.com, or at the door for $20. Discounts are available for groups of 10 or more.\n\n Partial proceeds will support the Anhelo Project, a non-for-profit organization in the City of Chicago that aims to close the income gap and increase academic opportunity for low to middle income, underrepresented minority students that require financial support to continue with their post-secondary education. In 2009, a group of committed college students and advisors sought to create change by hosting a gala event to raise funds in order to award scholarships for highly qualified students. Many of these students are leaders in their communities, but unfortunately cannot access the financial means to fund their undergraduate education. The Dream Scholarship is available to undocumented students residing in Illinois, attending any college or university within the city limits of Chicago.\n\nThe Chicago Outfit's official \u201clittle sister\u201d league, the Chicago Riots Youth Roller Derby team, will play during the first halftime. Coached and mentored by members of The Outfit, the Chicago Riots were founded in fall of 2009 and are open to girls ages 12-18 who have not graduated high school. The second halftime entertainment will be a crowd activity.  \n\nAdditional treats and entertainment will be available for all to enjoy. Check out the \u201cFan Zone,\u201d featuring games, temporary tattoos, a coloring book (hand-designed by the skaters), face painting and more.  Friends and fans can strike a pose in the free photo booth, compliments of 9 Muses Photo. Beer and wine will be available for purchase, the latter courtesy of Derby LITE.

Well we say \u201cemerging\u201d but Tevo has been spinning records since 1987, when he\u2019d barely hit puberty. Growing up in Chicago at that time, it was perhaps inevitable that he\u2019d catch the house bug. But his interest in music went beyond that, and he would later study music and bass guitar at college as well as several degrees in different subjects embarked upon by the academically gifted.\n\nSince his teens Tevo has come a long way, being a major player in the underground house scene running Chicago based Label \u201cBeautiful Granville Records\u201d named after a three block stretch that he lives on in Chicago and \u201cTevo Howard Recordings\u201d,  As well as releasing on labels such as Rebirth, Buzzin' Fly Records and Sounds Of The Universe. Now moving his base of operation to Berlin he has had the pleasure of remixing the likes of Midland, Dusky, Suspect, Ben Sun as well as being remixed by the likes of Marcus Worgull, Noir & Martin Thompson and Francis Inferno Orchestra to name a few.\n\n \n\nLittle more needs to be said about this man his soul full productions and hypnotic sets speak for themselves. He started to DJ at roughly thirteen or fourteen years old, putting us back to about 1987. After a skateboard accident in 1987, He decided being a DJ was a hobby that wasn\u2019t either illegal, or dangerous, and that it would be fun to DJ his own music. Needless to say it became an addiction, It started by walking down to Gramaphone Records and bought one record, \u201cTrue Faith,\u201d New Order\u201d.\n\n \n\n\u201cI am grateful to have Grown up in the Chicago record scene, because it provided a medium to apply my curious mind as a young musician\u201d.\n\n \n\n\nLINKS :-\n\n-http://tevohoward.com/\n-http://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/tevohoward\n-https://soundcloud.com/tevohowardrecordings\n\n\nMIXES :-\n\n\n-http://boilerroom.tv/recording/tevo-howard-live-in-the-boiler-room/\n\n-http://www.mixcloud.com/dazed/exclusive-tevo-howard-mix/\n\n-http://www.mixcloud.com/FACTMixArchive/fact-mix-225-tevo-howard/\n\n-https://soundcloud.com/soul-jazz-records/tevo-howard-mix-for-sounds-of\n\n\n\n  GROOVE THEORY DJs :-\n\n\n\nTOM BATEMAN b2b OWAIN HEPPLE\n\n\nBEN SMITH b2b SEAN MORGAN\n\n\nJAKE MERCANOGLU\n\n\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n\n*******COMPETITION DETAILS********\n\nWIN X2 FESTIVAL TICKETS TO DIMENSIONS FESTIVAL 2014!!!\n\nINFO WILL BE ANNOUNCED VERY SOON!!!!\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nBUY TICKETS :- http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/dimensions-2014-launch-series-cardiff-groove-theory-pres-tevo-howard-chicago-tickets-11131335123\n\nEARLY : \u00a37 (Limited)\n\nSTANDARD : \u00a38\n\nDOORS : Tbc\n\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\n\nUndertone (10 Feet tall)\n12 Church Street\nCF10 1BG\n18+",

ONLY with password.\n\nGabriel & Dresden \n\nFor electronic dance music fanatics, the year 2011 marks a new musical promise. After three years of work apart, the critically acclaimed and multiple award winning duo of Josh Gabriel and Dave Dresden are back together with a new energy and spirit. \n\nIn 2001, Josh and Dave joined forces under the now legendary Gabriel & Dresden moniker. Within their 6 years of collaboration, Gabriel & Dresden scored 19 number 1 Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play remixes and tracks, made three DJ-mixed compilation albums, an artist album and won seven International Dance Music Awards. Their tracks 'Arcadia', 'Dangerous Power', 'Let Go', 'Tracking Treasure Down' Andain \"Beautiful Things\" and numerous other masterpieces have turned into some of EDM\u2019s biggest classics. 'As The Rush Comes', by their Motorcycle alias with Jes Brieden, they won the IDMA award for 'Best Progressive Trance Track' as well as peaking at #11 on the official UK top40 charts. The G&D treatment, through remixes and interpretations, was given to tracks by The Killers, Annie Lenox, Sarah McLachlan, Dido, Ti\u00ebsto, Paul Oakenfold and Way Out West, making their sound cross borders from trance and progressive with pop, indie and soul sensibilities.\n\nIn 2008 After 6+ years of hits and and awards, both guys felt it was time for something new and took a break from Gabriel & Dresden to focus on their individual careers. Inspiration came flowing with the new tide. After the split, Josh Gabriel set up his own label, 'Different Pieces' and focused on his Winter Kills and Andain projects. On his album 'Eight', Josh intertwined techno and house into pieces of pure electronic bliss. In the meantime, Dave Dresden took charge of the dancefloor with his Dresden & Johnston project and spawned a US radio hit in the song 'Keep Faith' and \"That Day\" (with Nadia Ali on lead vocals), as well as remixes for the likes of Owl City, Nadia Ali, BT and The Crystal Method. But you simply can't stop musical synergy. \n\nAs 2010 came to an end, Gabriel and Dresden decided to go back to their roots and reunite at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles for New Year\u2019s Eve 2011. Their return behind the decks showed that after two and a half years apart, nothing really changed. Gabriel & Dresden's comeback marks one of the most notable moments in EDM this year, finally answering the call of millions of dance lovers. With gigs at some of the world's biggest festivals, clubs and events planned and a new compilation in the making, Gabriel & Dresden are all set to do what they love most: celebrate music. And we're all invited.",

We\u2019re about making that happen: connecting lesbians and building a network of colleagues, associates and friends in the industry.\r\n\r\nTo Be More Visible To Others\r\n\r\nOutside of Ellen, Rosie, Melissa, and now Tammy, what other mainstream lesbian role models can most people name? We need more examples of lesbian leaders and that means we need to come out as the amazing, successful people we are.\r\n\r\nTo Get More Women and Lesbians in Technology\r\n\r\nLesbians are women first, and right now women are some of the most gifted folks in technology, yet there are far fewer of us than there should be (women account for 1 in 15 people in STEM fields). Because there aren\u2019t enough women, women are rarely quoted as experts by the mainstream media and blogs, on panels, etc. And add the element of being lesbian, it\u2019s equally important for us to represent women, and out women, for our communities.",

        "description": "So one of my goals for awhile has been that I wanted to run a marathon before age 30.  I just turned 28, and I did the half marathon last year.  So, this year is the year that I am going to do it!  I am also going to do the Shamrock Shuffle, possibly the solider field 10 miler, and one of the half marathons.   \n\nI decided to join Imerman Angels and agreed to raise $1000.\n\nI am throwing a Wristband party at Schoolyard Tavern  on April 26th from 8-11.  The wristband is $25, half of that will go to the fundraiser.  I will also be having a raffle for some great prizes. (gift cards, apparel, tickets, etc.)  I am in the process of collecting items for the raffle, so if you have anything you would like to donate or know anyone else that can please message me or text/call me (715-220-5138).  I would greatly appreciate it!!! \n\nIf any of you cannot make it to this fundraiser, but would like to support me running the Chicago Marathon and help raise money for a great cause you can go to the link below and donate.  EVERY dollar counts :)\n\n\nhttp://www.crowdrise.com/stephanieclarke1-TeamIA/fundraiser/stephanieclarke1\n\nA little information on Imerman Angels for those of you that are not familiar: \n\nTeam Imerman Angels is a group of individuals who like to stay fit and have fun.

Crimes Against Humanity is a nihilistic romp through gossipy academic parties, boozy-stake outs, and surreal bedtime stories.\u201d\u2014Jerzy Rose\n\n\u201cRose and co-writer Halle Butler are masters of wry humor, delighting in their characters\u2019 self-pity, casual dishonesty and cruelty. Mike Lopez and Lyra Hill are beyond perfect in the lead roles, generating spark showers of subtextual resentment in their scenes together.\u201d\u2014Paul Sbrizzi, Slamdance Film Festival\n\n\u201cRecalls the fiction of Thomas Pynchon in its mix of conspiracy plots, academic references, and loopy humor\u2026Rose creates a distinct, propulsive rhythm for the comic dialogue.\u201d\u2014Chicago Reader\n\n\u201cStar Lyra Hill\u2019s wide-eyed, increasingly mangled deadpan gaze is worthy of a silent comedy all its own.\u201d\u2014Chicago Tribune",

        "description": "We are happy to have one of Chicago's finest DJs back at The Bower, Diz. Last year he played for the For Those Who Know 12 Year Anniversary party and delivered the dance floor a lengthy set of house education! If you're into house come experience a special night with one Chicago's house aficionados! \n\nFor Those Who Know...\nSATURDAY MARCH 29\nDIZ (Chicago / Iz and Diz)\n\nwith resident\nJUNIOR BROWN\n\n$15 COVER\nDoors at 8pm\nHalf price cocktails from 8pm-10pm\n\nDIz (bio)\nIf life is about \"being in the right place at the right time,\" then Diz's timing could not have been better. Born and raised in Chicago, the original epicenter of the House Music uni-verse, his adolescence coincided with the beginnings of that city's legendary scene. Nowadays, if you mention Diz's name amongst House aficionados, you are almost cer-tain to hear adoration and respect for his insane DJ skills, stage presence, and warm-hearted personality.\n\n\nDiz's musical influences started at home, where his mother's love for Jazz led him to pursue the saxophone for many years. His DJ beginnings were about whatever he could get his hands on, like Disco and old Breaks records inherited from family members. When he was 14, his older brother took him to The Music Box, where Diz witnessed the true potential of House Music: to affect people's emotions and bring them together on a collective journey. He's been striving to do just that ever since, and in the process, has become a faithful participant in the music, the culture, and the times.\n\n\nThroughout high school, he frequented parties featuring DJs such as Frankie Knuckles, Ron Hardy, Farley and many other masters, and finally had a chance to break into the scene at age 19 after meeting contemporaries Mark Farina, Derrick Carter and Spencer Kincey (Gemini). His early gigs were at Alcazar with Gemini, and at one-off parties. At his Wicker Park loft, what started as a means of paying the rent developed into a two-year run as a nightclub, featuring Diz, Farina and Mark Grant on the decks. Soon after-wards, he and his friends took over Shelter, one of the city's \"most severe night spots.\" >From roughly 1993-98, Diz was the Friday resident at Shelter, and the Saturday resi-dent at Red Dog alongside Johnny Fiasco, and since then has held many residencies at other legendary Chicago spots.\n\n\nIn 1995, Diz accepted a job working for his brother's friend, Anthony Pearson (Chez Damier), at PRESCRIPTION (the label founded by Chez and Ron Trent). PRESCRIP-TION conducted distribution business with CAJUAL, and that is how Diz met his future producing partner and close friend, Joshua (whose nickname as fate would have it, was \"Iz\").\n\n\nIn 1995, Iz n Diz produced their first record together, \"Ghosts in Detroit,\" released on PRESCRIPTION's sub-label, BALANCE. A year later, Joshua/Iz moved back to San Francisco, but he and Diz maintained a close friendship over the years and continue to produce together for labels like CLASSIC, AESOTERIC, GUIDANCE, TWEEKIN', SIL-VER NETWORK, and PANHANDLE.",

By purchasing a ticket to the event, you will be able to take advantage of a premium open bar, Harry Caray's catered appetizer/dinner buffet, and a 3-hour boat cruise along the beautiful Chicago River and Lake Michigan with fireworks shooting off above.  More importantly, by purchasing a ticket, you will be supporting The Monday Life and assisting the process of aiding hospitalized children.  \n\nWe are beyond excited to be hosting the First Annual \"The Monday Life Presents:  Chicago's 1/7\" - a formal gala to help hospitalized children heal.  Treat yourself to an awesome evening and support this awesome cause! \n\n*****TO PURCHASE YOUR TICKET, PLEASE VISIT: \nwww.themondaylife.eventbrite.com\n\n**A portion of your ticket cost is tax deductible.  We can provide a tax form to prove your donation amount upon request.\n\nhttp://www.themondaylife.org/\n\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT THE MONDAY LIFE AND THE PROJECT THAT THE MONEY RAISED FROM THIS EVENT WILL FUND:\n\nThe Monday Life is a non-profit organization that helps hospitalized children feel better and heal faster. The Monday Life does this by drastically improving patient environments in hospitals.\n\nThe idea started off small and simple- Get people to donate $1 every single Monday. These funds added up, and the success of the organization followed. The Monday Life now works with numerous children\u2019s across the US.  By donating $1 every Monday, people could STOP HATING MONDAYS since they know they are doing good and supporting a great cause.  The funds raised by The Monday Life have gone toward projects that have resulted in enhanced health for patients (scientifically proven--see The Monday Life website) such as:  Art therapy projects, Music therapy projects, Massage therapy project, Pet therapy projects, and Enhanced technology projects.\n\nOur goal is to host a succesful charity event that raises funds to support The Monday Life projects.   Specifically, our event will fund a project involving the renovation of a rundown basketball court / playground at Duke Children's Hospital. Take a minute out of your day and watch the video below for more information on the project: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6_tBYL7I-s\n\n\nWE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU SATURDAY, JUNE 7TH AT 7:30PM.",

        "description": "Uno dei grandi eventi della Birroteca Doppio Malto \u00e8 il graditissimo ritorno in Italia del leggendario cantautore di Chicago Michael McDermott, accompagnato in acustico dalla moglie Heather Horton al violino e ai cori. \nOrmai da oltre 20 anni nel business della musica, McDermott ha esordito con una vera e propria pietra miliare del rock, quel \"620 W. Surf\" che gli dette la fama nel 1991, e in cui molti lo definirono un degno erede di fuoriclasse con Dylan e Springsteen. Ha diviso il palco con gente come Van Morrison, Cowboy Junkies, Natalie Merchant e Wallflowers, e lo scrittore Stephen King lo annovera tra i suoi cantautori preferiti, citandolo in pi\u00f9 di un romanzo. Il film \"Rounders - Il Giocatore\", con Matt Damon e Edward Norton e scritto dal suo amico/produttore Brian Koppelman (autore anche della serie degli \"Ocean's\" con George Clooney), \u00e8 in parte ispirato alla sua vita. Particolare \u00e8 il suo feeling con l'Italia, dove s'\u00e8 sposato proprio 5 anni fa, nel maggio 2009.\n\nUn appuntamento imperdibile con un cantautore dalla personalit\u00e0 e dal magnetismo ineguagliabili, che passa da emozionanti ballate a decise sferzate folk-rock.\n\nwww.michael-mcdermott.com\n\nNon mancate!!!",

Are they artists who play music or musicians who paint. Performers or painters? Yes, they are. Come to Gallery Bar Thursday, May 1st to see the battle of the Renaissance men. \n\nSpencer Hutchinson is a visual artist who discovered electronic music in 2007 and began the Ersatz Modem Project. His goal: apply to electronic music production the same attitude that Modern artists would apply to Abstract painting. \n\nChadwick is a musician, an actor, an emcee and, quite literally, a performance artist - as he prefers to paint in public, on stage. \u201cThere\u2019s just something about the audience being right there.\u201d\n\nSo come on down, save some art and meet our soul-stirring duo and all of the other artists who are brave enough to face the ax man. \n\nABOUT Rescue-or-Destroy : \n\nThe next \u201cRescue-or-Destroy Art Tournament\u201d will be May 1st at Gallery Bar in Chicago. Experience it! There's nail biting suspense, action-packed drama, tears and jeers and a big bald man with an ax. \n\nRescue-or-Destroy is like a sports tournament for art - an \u201cArt Tourney.\u201d Eight pairs of artists compete, tournament style, in a bi-weekly event at Gallery Bar in River North. \n\nIt works like this\u2026\n\nSixteen artists are selected to participate and are paired up to create eight initial duos. Each artist brings a piece of art (their choice) for the event and the audience is called on to \u201crescue,\u201d or \u201cdestroy\u201d (hack up into a million pieces) one of the two pieces presented on stage. \n\nIf you are an artist and want to participate. Contact Allen Vandever to find out how to be a guest artist.\n \nScedule: \n\nBout 6 May 1st\nBout 7 May 17th\nBout 8 june 5th\n\nPlayoffs begin in July...stay turned!!\n\nRescue or Destroy kicks off at 8pm on Saturday February 22nd at Gallery Bar \u2013 738 N.

This time with Local Heros Matt and Jake!\n\nFriday April 18th\n\n10:00 pm\n\n21+ \n\nFREE SHOW!\n\n\nChicago Farmer sings on the title track of Backenforth, IL, out January 22, 2013. It\u2019s the centerpiece of his sixth collection of Guthrie-inspired populist songs, as well as autobiographical. The son of a small town farming community, Cody Diekhoff logged plenty of highway and stage time under the name Chicago Farmer before settling in the city in 2003. Profoundly inspired by fellow mid-westerner John Prine, he\u2019s a working-class folk musician to his core. His small town roots, tilled with city streets mentality, are turning heads North and South of I-80.\n\nBackenforth, IL is also about finding your place in life \u2013 that sweet spot where we all belong. \u201cI love the energy, music, and creativity of Chicago, but at the same time, the roots and hard work of my small town,\u201d he shares. Growing up in Delavan, IL with a population less than 2,000, Diekhoff\u2019s grandparents were farmers, and their values have always provided the baseline of his songs.\n\nHe writes music for the \u201ckind of people that come to my shows. Whether in Chicago or Delavan, everyone has a story, and everyone puts in a long day and works hard the same way,\u201d he says. \u201cMy generation may have been labeled as slackers, but I don\u2019t know anyone who doesn\u2019t work hard \u2013 many people I know put in 50-60 hours a week and 12 hour days. That\u2019s what keeps me playing. I don\u2019t like anyone to be left out; my music is for everyone in big and very small towns.\u201d\n\nHe listened to punk rock and grunge as a kid before discovering a friend\u2019s dad playing Hank Williams, and it was a revelation. Prine and Guthrie quickly followed. The name Chicago Farmer was originally for a band, but the utilitarian life of driving alone from bar to bar, city to city \u2013 to make a direct connection to his audience and listener, took a deeper hold.\n\nSongs like \u201cWorkin\u2019 On It,\u201d are the kind of sing-a-longs he\u2019s known for; it\u2019s become common to see whole rooms full of strangers erupt and sing to the choruses of his songs on first listen. While \u201cThe Twenty Dollar Bill\u201d is more sentimental, reminding everyone of that time their own Grandma surreptitiously passed along a little cash to hang onto.\n\nCody co-produced the album with Chris Harden in Chicago at the I.V. Labs Studios. While the inspiration has never changed, previous albums have been with Nashville session players \u2013 or just himself with guitar and harmonica.\n\nFor Backenforth, IL, he brought in friends for a loose and live vibe, accompanied by \u201cThe Hired Hands,\u201d Darren Garvey on percussion and Mike Davidov on bass. Cody and The Hired Hands were recorded live and on analog tape to capture the feel and authenticity of each performance. Later, some of Chicago\u2019s finest musicians chimed in on pedal steel, resonator, electric and acoustic guitar, organ, dobro, and vocals.\n\nChicago Farmer plans to continue touring relentlessly to support the new album.\n\nWith Backenforth IL, he solidifies that wherever he is, that\u2019s where he belongs, that\u2019s where the songs will be written and sung, and that\u2019s where the music will be played.",

This year we are super hyped to welcome back  Chicago\u2019s finest Disco don Rahaan headlining the bash with fantastic support over both floors. Advance tickets are on sale for a super bargain \u00a34 get them while you can folks we expect a sellout. Rahaan played a few years back at the Spacemachine launch and killed it so we are looking forward to hearing him do the disco again especially on the Bozak mixer.\n\nRahaan is without doubt one of the most traveled and in demand disco disc jockeys on the circuit, and according to the Redbull Academy 'he's not only a Dj, but a Dj's Dj.'Rahaan's been spinning music since the 80s, he got his schooling in disco music when he heard Ron Hardy play at the Music Box in his native Chicago. At the time other Djs like Pierre or Frankie Knuckles were throwing parties too, but it was the unique fashion Ron Hardy served up his disco and house - raw and real - that had left a long lasting impression on Rahaan. Since then, the brother from the Windy city has amassed a more than respectable record collection, mixing up the rare disco and classic always keeping his choice dance floor friendly. Over the years Rahaan has personalised plenty of classic tracks by transforming them into his trademark edits in a similar way Ron Hardy and Theo Parrish have done, with the only exception that he keeps close to the disco sound in his output, occasionally dipping into soul, boogie, jazz funk and funk territory. But above all, the essence of Rahaan's trademark sound is still undeniably 'Chicago' in its energy. There are plenty of soulful and uplifting, but never cheesy vocals. There is consistent groove in his boogie along type sets - all the way to his more bouncing and jackin' basement party style sets, in which you can literally feel the music, sweat and funk in the air. Over the years, plenty of Rahaan mixes that have appeared on sites like Bring The Heat, Deep House Page and the Chuck Brothers, and many fans have been wondering about those special extended and re-arranged and hard to find tracks. \n\nUpstairs hosted by Untitled. After a short break Untitled is back and we'll be helping you to kick start the bank holiday weekend with a very special party. For this event we've teamed up with the good people of the Horse and Groom and will be taking over the top floor of the infamous party pub. After throwing a string of successful parties in 2013 with guests including the likes of Nikos (Krush), Wesley Razzy (Rhythmatic), Bookless & Richard Rowell (Jaunt) we will be sticking to our policy of throwing exciting and intimate parties and have enlisted Stephane Ghenacia (Colors Lnd) to come along and make sure your bank holiday weekend starts off with a bang. Stephane is a new face in the scene who\u2019s hungry to emulate the success of the names he shares the DJ booth with. He's already gaining quite a reputation in the underground with appearances at Fabric's room one alongside Apollonia (Dan Ghenacia, Dyed Soundorom & Shonky). It's clear this guy has an ear for good music",

        "description": "GRZEGORZ TURNAU - polski pianista, kompozytor, aran\u017cer, wokalista i poeta, wyst\u0105pi w dniu 5 kwietnia, 2014 r., o godz. 19-tej, na jednym, d\u0142ugo wyczekiwanym koncercie w Copernicus Center, przy 5216 W. Lawrence Avenue, Chicago. \n\nWszechstronny artysta, kt\u00f3ry stworzy\u0142 sw\u00f3j w\u0142asny, \u0142atwo rozpoznawalny, pe\u0142en czaru i elegancji styl muzyczny i kompozycyjny, czasami nawi\u0105zuj\u0105cy do muzyki jazzowej, smooth-jazzowej, a tak\u017ce do dokona\u0144 Marka Grechuty i Jana Kantego Pawlu\u015bkiewicza, zaprezentuje kompozycje, kt\u00f3re cieszy\u0142y s\u0142uchaczy na przestrzeni niemal 20 lat jego kariery. Laureat wielu nagr\u00f3d, m.in. Mateusza (Nagrody Muzycznej Programu Trzeciego), Wiktora (Nagrody Akademii Telewizyjnej), dw\u00f3ch Superjedynek (plebiscytu w Opolu) oraz dziesi\u0119ciu Fryderyk\u00f3w, do kt\u00f3rych nominowany by\u0142 a\u017c 24 razy, cieszy si\u0119 nies\u0142abn\u0105cym uznaniem. Popularno\u015b\u0107 Turnaua to swoisty fenomen, kt\u00f3ry nie przestaje zadziwia\u0107. Uprawia on bowiem trudny gatunek piosenki z tekstem, czy piosenki poetyckiej spod znaku \u201ckrainy \u0142agodno\u015bci\u201d. Jego utwory to refleksyjne pere\u0142ki, w kt\u00f3rych na happy end raczej nie ma miejsca.  A jednak od wielu lat przyci\u0105ga s\u0142uchaczy, kt\u00f3rym nieobce s\u0105 inne rodzaje muzyki.  Niezwyk\u0142e poczucie humoru artysty, b\u0142yskotliwo\u015b\u0107 i jego dystans do samego siebie, jak i niemal sztubacka figlarno\u015b\u0107, spontaniczne \u017carty i swoiste flirty z publiczno\u015bci\u0105, buduj\u0105 niepowtarzalny nastr\u00f3j wyst\u0119p\u00f3w. Dzi\u0119ki temu recitale Turnaua zawsze pozostawiaj\u0105 publiczno\u015b\u0107 w zadumie, ale i dobrym humorze. Grzegorz Turnau prowadzi z ni\u0105 dialog, spe\u0142niaj\u0105c jej oczekiwania dotycz\u0105ce repertuaru. W zale\u017cno\u015bci od emocji, kt\u00f3re towarzysz\u0105 koncertom, zmienia si\u0119 lista wykorzystywanych utwor\u00f3w. Dlatego ka\u017cde spotkanie z widzami jest inne i niepowtarzalne, a  ka\u017cdy spektakl unikatowy.\n\nKoncert b\u0119dzie wielk\u0105 gratk\u0105 dla fan\u00f3w Grzegorza Turnaua tak\u017ce w warstwie instrumentalnej. Towarzysz\u0105cy wokali\u015bcie Jacek Kr\u00f3lik (gitara), Robert Kubiszyn (gitara basowa, kontrabas), Leszek Szczerba (saksofon, klarnet) i Cezary Konrad (perkusja), to znani i cenieni muzycy jazzowi, \u015bwietni instrumentali\u015bci i autorzy wielu w\u0142asnych przedsi\u0119wzi\u0119\u0107 artystycznych. W kwintecie, prowadz\u0105 z wokalem i fortepianem lidera pe\u0142noprawny d\u017awi\u0119kowy dialog, uwidaczniaj\u0105cy ich w\u0142asne muzyczne osobowo\u015bci.\n\nElitarny Grzegorz Turnau, w doborowym towarzystwie swojego zespolu, a wraz z nimi \u201cWszystko, co piekne...\u201d ju\u017c 5 kwietnia!\n\nBILETY:\n\n773-415-4910, POLAMER, KSIEGARNIE: D&Z, WRONA\n\nwww.bilety.com, www.kulturka.us, www.uptosound.com, www.copernicuscenter.org",

On Tuesday, March 11, 2014, Attorney and Managing Partner for Lumumba, Freelon & Associates, Chokwe Antar announced his intent to seek the mayor's office for the city of Jackson, Mississippi.  Attorney Lumumba, a gifted Human Rights and Criminal Defense Attorney, will seek to carry on the vision of The People's Platform that he and his father developed together as he served as campaign co-chair for his father's mayoral bid just one year ago.\n\nIn a recent Final Call interview, Chokwe Antar stated the following: \"I think now it's necessary that we continue the vision and the work of the people.  It's too critical. We cannot leave that in idle hands or with people who do not understand the principles which must guide our leadership and guide our people.\"  This is why Stan, Conrad and I support Chokwe Antar Lumumba and his campaign to fill this vital office.\n\nPlease join us on April 4, 2014 for this momentous event and help us elect Chokwe A. Lumumba as Mayor of the city of Jackson, Mississippi.  We look forward to seeing you on 4/4/14 at Carruthers Center for Inner City Studies, 700 E.

What follows is an album as pretty as it is noisy and jarring, displacing the lessons learned during adolescence with instinct and naivety. Television Fuzz studies the existential crises that comes on the onset of every graduation; from high school, from college, from one job to the next, but most importantly, graduating from adolescence to adulthood.\n\nDRAFT WEEK\n\nChicago is home to some of alternative rock's most acclaimed artists including the Smashing Pumpkins and Wilco.
