Please post all your pictures and videos in this event as well as our facebook pages. Please chat in this event and continue to post. \n\nI hope everyone is ready for round 2. There are many world protests happening on May 1, 2014. So I think we should join them all. Let us make it our goal on May 1, 2014 to get out and protest once again to help wake up the masses. At this point that is what the protests are doing in many places. Getting us out in the public and the public asking questions so we can educate them. It shows them not to be afraid to get out and protest. With each protest our numbers are growing. Once we have the numbers on our side, the change we seek will follow. \n\nOnce again the focus will be on world wide government corruption. Our goal is to wake up and educate the masses with this 4 day protest. Be peaceful and Loud! \n\nOnce again let us unite all groups for this event. Every one is welcome.\n\nTHIS TIME IT IS A 4 DAY EVENT TO REALLY WAKE UP THE MASSES. NOT EVERYONE CAN BE THERE ALL FOUR DAYS BUT PLEASE COME OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DURING THE 4 DAY EVENT!\n\n\nPeace and respect to everyone.",

Apart from being recognized as one of the leading classical artists, Maksin has taken the cello well outside its conventional scope and plays jazz, world music, blues, flamenco, rock, R&B, pop, and has collaborated with such artists as Sting, Andrea Bocelli, P. Diddy, Snoop Dogg and Gloria Estefan.\n\nOfficial Website: www.ianmaksin.com\nFacebook Fanpage:  www.facebook.com/CelloMaxx\nYouTube Channel: www.youtube.com/leftseat75\nTwitter:  www.twitter.com/IanMaksin",

Mai bekommt Linz hohen Besuch aus USA. Der aus Chicago stammende Techno-Pionier MIKE DEARBORN kommt in den Linzer Cembrankeller. Als DJ und Produzent seit den fr\u00fchen Neunziger, z\u00e4hlt er wohl mit zu einem der ganz gro\u00dfen in diesem Genre. Als junger Produzent unter der Flagge des ber\u00fchmten Labels Djax up Beats, welches heuer das 25 Jahre Jubil\u00e4um feiert, trug Mike Dearborn ma\u00dfgeblich mit zu dessen Erfolg bei. Er schaffte es sogar auf dem Album \u201eHomeworks\u201c von \u201eDaft Punk\u201c namentlich als Inspiration erw\u00e4hnt zu werden. Den weltweit gebuchten DJ-Namen Mike Dearborn kennt man in Europa von gro\u00dfen intern. Festivals und Raves wie z.B. Mayday und Awakenings. Unser Motto von \"Mit Techno alt werden- Feiern wie fr\u00fcher\" wird seinem Titel gerecht, wenn sein 120 Minuten Oldschhool-Set den Cembrankeller in einen Dampfkessel verwandelt und f\u00fcr eine unvergessliche Nacht sorgen wird. Support bekommt Mike Dearborn von Martin Mueller, dem Linzer Labelbesitzer von \u201eHOME Recordings, welcher mit seinem Label seit 2006 konsiquent seinen Weg verfolgt und daf\u00fcr mit internationaler Aufmerksamkeit belohnt wurde. So hat ihn Dave Clarke auf der Playlist und der bekannte DJ und Producer Mark EG, Redakteur beim Tilllate Magazine vergleicht ihn mit einen Global Player wie Robert Hood.  Chicago- Legende Mike Dearborn ist auf der 2011 erschienenen 12 Vinyl von Martin Muellers HOME Recordings namens \u201eAsso\u201c mit einem Remix vertreten.\n\nWeiters supporten Mike Dearborn die beiden bekannten Oldschool-Veteranen und DJ\u2018s Burne Maximilian und Dean Lee.

Glowing runners come from all different ages, shapes, sizes, and speeds; but everyone who shows up to get Glowed\u2122 has the time of their life. Whether you are an avid runner or a walk around the park walker, the 3 miles of the Blacklight Run\u2122 course will have you glowing and waiting for the next one!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Blacklight Run\u2122 has been setup with very simple rules:\n\n1) White shirts (any white T-shirt will work) worn at the start line.\n\n2) Glow covered runners at the Finish! Runner/walkers begin the 5k at the start line like a brand new canvas.\n\nBy the end, they look like they fell into a ghost busters movie and are covered with different colored Glow\u2122. This is the first of its kind at night and is quickly sweeping the nation!\n\nEach person running will receive:\n\n- Blacklight Run T-Shirt\n- Special Offers from Sponsors\n- Race Bib\n- Glow Pack to throw at the finish line!\n\nWhat is the Glow?\n\nAlong the running path you will find Glow Zone's, which are associated with a designated color: green, pink, or blue. As the runners/walkers reach the Glow Zones they are showered with neon powder that glows under our high beam black lights. All products are 100% natural and non-toxic. At the end of the race there will be a Blacklight Run\u2122 Party filled with Music pumping from the DJ, Glowing Neon Powder and tons of black lights!\n\n\nWhat about the finish line?\n\nAre you ready for the best After Race party on the PLANET. After the finish, participants are encouraged to stick around, celebrate, and see exactly how much Glow one person can handle. We will have Glow, and festivities that will make your Glowing head spin.\n\nStay Tuned\n\nFor the latest race updates and runner giveaways stay tuned to this web page, or follow Blacklight Run\u2122 Facebook or Twitter pages.",

Columbus.\n\nFor those coming in on pubtran, the Randolph Metra station and the Randolph & Michigan bus stop (or the Michigan & Randolph bus stop) are both right there.\n\nAfter the battle, join us across the street for Chicago style deep dish at Giordano's!\n\nINTERNATIONAL PILLOW FIGHT DAY RULES OF ENGAGEMENT\n________________________________________\n1. PLEASE DO NOT BRING FEATHER OR DOWN PILLOWS.\n2. IF YOU DO BRING A FEATHER OR DOWN PILLOW, DO NOT TEAR IT OPEN.\n3.

DO NOT SWING AT PERSONS NOT HOLDING PILLOWS.\n6. DO NOT SWING AT PERSONS HOLDING CAMERAS.\n7. SMALL CHILDREN ARE FRAGILE! PLEASE PUMMEL THE HOBBITS WITH CARE!\n8. WATCH OUT FOR VEHICLE AND FOOT TRAFFIC- STAY OUT OF STREETS AND WALKWAYS AND TRY NOT TO INTERFERE WITH NON-PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS.\n9. OBEY ALL POSTED LAWS AND INSTRUCTIONS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.\n10. PLEASE, NO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES OR RECREATIONAL SUBSTANCES (EVEN THE LEGAL ONES). THIS IS A FAMILY EVENT!\n11. EVERYONE IS ENCOURAGED TO STAY AND HELP CLEAN UP IF NECESSARY!\n\nInternational Pillow Fight Day is a global celebration of the ancient art of pillow fighting. Throughout history, pillow fighting has been the civilized form of battle which results in victory for all who take part. Come, raise your trustiest war-pillow to remind destructive forces everywhere that the only truly valiant fights are won with stuffing and cloth!\n\nWe also want this event to be safe and respectful to the community that hosts it, so please read and follow the guidelines on the opposite side of the flyer. We're here to have fun and make people smile, and maybe even to make some people realize that life isn't all work and no play; but there will always be those for whom such pastimes are \"childish\" or \"inappropriate\". These people can't be saved, so just let them be. Additionally, this is a family friendly and community friendly event, so please don't engage in any illegal or reckless behaviors. Pillow fighting can be a blast without anybody needing to take a ride downtown. Let's make sure the only people getting smacked are those who want to be!\n\nA word about feathers- I know some pillow fighters really enjoy the flying feathers, but the simple truth is that a huge blizzard of down floating around the streets, parks, and into the river is a nightmare to clean up, not just for us, but for the dedicated city sanitation employees who are probably underpaid and overworked. Beyond that, it's not kind to the environment, or to our fellow citizens. So, like the owl says, \"Give a Hoot, Don't Pollute!\"\n\nTrash bags and gloves will be provided for those who want to help clean up after the event. Heck, you can even clean up the regular litter if you want- no reason we can't give back a little, right? When clean up is done, please join us for post-battle refreshments and tales of heroic deeds at a local eatery!\n\nThere are cities all around the world, from Amsterdam to Zurich, participating in Pillow Fight Day, and you can see all the cool places joining the battle at pillowfightday.com\n\nLet's make sure Chicago remains one of the most memorable, fantastic, fun, and safe cities to pillow fight in, and let's show those other cities that we can pummel with the best of 'em!\n________________________________________",

The 15-date summer tour, presented by Live Nation, will take the bands through major metropolitan areas across the United States including New York City, Boston, Dallas, Phoenix, Detroit and more with even more dates to be announced soon.  Tickets for the general public go on sale on starting Friday, January 17 through the Live Nation mobile app and at www.livenation.com.  \n\nCiti\u00ae cardmembers will have access to presale tickets beginning Wednesday, January 15 at 10:00 AM local time through Citi's Private Pass\u00ae Program.  For complete presale details, visit www.citiprivatepass.com.  Live Nation mobile app users (available for both iOS and Android) will have access to presale tickets beginning Thursday, January 16 at 10:00 AM local time.  Band fan club presales will begin on January 14 at 10:00 AM local time.  All presales end at 10:00 PM local time on Thursday, January 16.  \n\n\"It's ironic, that these two legendary bands, who both have roots in Illinois, were label-mates (Columbia/Epic) in the 70's, and experienced waves of immense success in the 80's and 90's, and have somehow continued to consistently make compelling music, both in-studio and on tour.... have never before performed together!\" says Chicago's Robert Lamm.  \"This situation is about to change, as Chicago and REO will perform together during the concert's encore and present a finale that will thrill their audiences. As a musician who has always respected REO's skills, I look forward to our first rehearsals early this summer.  This will be fun!\"\n\n\"With so many personal connections between various members of REO and Chicago, it is amazing that we have never actually toured together. I love it that the Chicago guys feel the way we do about truly playing together when you tour together,\" says REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin.  \"Can you imagine the Chicago horn section on 'Roll With the Changes'? That would blow my mind! This tour promises to deliver some unique music from two bands who have made a ton of hit records, share that Midwest work ethic, and still refuse to sit back on their past accomplishments. We both keep raising the bar, challenging ourselves, and rocking hard... and the audience is the ultimate winner. We are psyched... I can't wait for this tour.\"\n\nAll dates below subject to change.

Glowing runners come from all different ages, shapes, sizes, and speeds. Whether you are a long term runner or a walk around the park stroller, the 3 miles of the Foam Glow 5K\u2122 course will have you shining brite and waiting for the next run.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe Foam Glow 5K\u2122 has been setup with very simple rules:\n\n1) White shirt (any white T-shirt will work) worn at the start line. The more white you wear the better.\n\n2) Foam Glow 5K\u2122 runners sprinting through Foam Glow\u2122 Zones to the Finnish line!\n\nRunner/walkers begin the 5k at the start line like a brand new canvas. By the end, they look like they fell into a tye-dye machine and are covered with different colored foam that glows under black lights.\n\nWhat is the Foam Glow\u2122?\n\nAlong the running path you will find Foam Glow\u2122 Zone's, which are associated with a designated color: Orange, Pink, or Orange. As the runners/walkers reach the Foam Glow\u2122 Zones, They they will run through different color foam that Glows in the Dark under our high intensity black lights. All products are 100% natural and non-toxic. At the end of the race there will be a Foam Glow 5K\u2122 after party filled with Music pumping from the stage, Foam Glow\u2122 and tons of black lights!\n\nEvery Registered Runner gets:\n\n- Foam Glow 5K\u2122 Event T-Shirt\n- Get blasted by foam at our Glow Zones\n- Sonsor Goodies\n- The best night of their life\n\n\nWhat about the finish line?\n\nAre you ready for the best After Race party in the world? After the finish, participants are encouraged to stick around, celebrate, and see exactly how much fun one person can handle. In most locations we will have food, Foam Glow 5K\u2122, and festivities that will make your Foam Glowed head spin.\n\nDon't forget to get the latest updates on our facebook page!",

        "description": "The  Operature is a live performance and augmented reality (AR) poem engaging themes of anatomical science and spectacle. The work\u2019s choreography and use of technology are influenced by research into a series of diverse anatomical histories including early-modern surgical theatres, Francis Glessner Lee's miniature crime scene re-enactments known as the Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death, and The Stud File, an autobiographical record of the sexual exploits of Samuel Steward, a 20th century tattoo artist, gay pornographer, and friend of Gertrude Stein.\n\n The performance is extended by a 25 screen interactive exhibition on the ground floor based on the concept of an operating theatre. The Operature includes an interactive operating table that controls screen-based content and distributes virtual AR overlays that can be viewed through mobile devices. A smart-phone is not required as the work's elaborate set includes a series of viewing stations. \n\n ATOM-R is a provisional collective exploring forensics, anatomy, and 21st century embodiment through performance, language and emerging technologies. Participants include Mark Jeffery (choreography), Judd Morrissey (technology and dramaturgical systems), Justin Deschamps, Sam Hertz, Christopher Knowlton, and Blake Russell,(collaborators/performers) with Meghan Moe Beitiks (Technical Director), Andrew Pace (Textile Artist), Laura Prieto-Velasco (Prop / Jeweller)  Alfredo Salazar - Caro (New Media Artist), Bryan Saner (Master Carpenter), Kate Hampel (Costumes), Company Manager Stephanie Acosta and Studio Assistant Alexandria Eregbu.\n\nATOM-R co-founders Judd Morrissey and Mark Jeffery are a collaboration merging digital literary practices and performance (2003 - ). A given piece may have no singular fixed form is alternately or simultaneously presented as internet art, durational live installation or a performance of fixed length. Both artists were members of Goat Island Performance Group.\n\nThe work is partially supported by a grant from the Chicago Dancemakers Forum and commissioning support from the European research group ELMCIP (Electronic Literature as a Model for Creativity and Innovation in Practice) in collaboration with Edinburgh College of Art and New Media Scotland. The piece has also been supported by The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and by artist's workshops at Dance4, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, York St John University and the Department of English at King\u2019s College London and supported by the Innovation programme at the Cultural Institute at King\u2019s College London. The work is also supported by the National Museum of Health and Medicine Chicago with the collective being artists in residence at the Museum. \n\n \n\nPLEASE NOTE ALL TICKET SALES GO TO ATOM-R's LINKS HALL FISCAL ACCOUNT.

The first one will depart that location at 12:00 PM. The second will depart at 3:00 PM. If you would rather stay at Federal Plaza than march with us, fliers will be provided for you to pass out if you have not brought your own.\n\nPeople with opinions across the political spectrum are invited to unite and find common ground against corruption. We will overcome the petty divide created by more or less meaningless party lines and conquer propaganda by forming communities of support and compassion. Together we will begin a sustained fight for freedom and begin engaging in a relentless campaign of nonviolent civil disobedience. People will pledge to take part in whatever tactics they are interested in throughout a sustained three-month cycle. Here are some examples of these tactics:\n\n\t>Mass gatherings, demonstrations;\n\t>Marches, Parades;\n\t>Flash mobs, swarms;\n\t>Worker Strikes;\n\t>Hunger Strikes;\n\t>Sit-ins;\n\nA more complete list of tactics is available on the description of the worldwide event: https://waveofaction.org/job/worldwide-wave-launch-gatherings/\n\nWe MUST come together and unite if we hope to enact any real change. You know what you can do to help make this happen, DO IT!! If we can all come together as a species and act as one I have no doubt this movement will succeed.",

This music was born from Jews exiled from Spain and Portugal, traveling through the former Ottoman lands: Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Morocco. As such, the group brings together instruments and traditions from the wide span of cultures that fed into this musical language historically, updating it with their own youthful energy and contemporary backgrounds in jazz improvisation and electronica. Embracing the old and the new, members perform on instruments both ancient and modern, and have made names for themselves collectively and individually in traditional settings and on YouTube.\n\nYael Badash - Lead Vocal \nJonathan (Yonnie) Dror - Wind Instruments \nThomas Moked - String Instruments\nDaniel Sapir - Upright Bass\nYshai Afterman - Percussion\n\nPhoto by Omri Barel",

Having been a mainstay of the Northeast \u201cjam circuit\u201d for years, Jimkata\u2019s refined \u201celectro rock\u201d sound \u2013 one of a band that has found it\u2019s voice after years of experimentation \u2013 is in many ways more \u201cindie rock\u201d than jam, more 90\u2032s dance than EDM, more lyrical than instrumental, yet the band manages to keep the jam, EDM and technically advanced instrumental elements intact as it carves out a new path for themselves and many of their peers who were inspired by Die Digital. Jimkata\u2019s relevant, quotable lyrics create moods not just for the fleeting moments, but for the lifestyle of an entire generation, and the sum of the music and songwriting appeals to fans of artists like MGMT, LCD Soundsystem, Talking Heads and the best of the \u201990\u2032s pop-rock world. A staple of the festival circuit from the Rockies to the Atlantic, Jimkata\u2019s 2013 festival schedule included heavy hitters like Summer Camp (Chillicothe, IL), Gathering of The Vibes (Bridgeport, CT), Catskill Chill (Hancock, NY), Rootwire (Logan, OH) among many others.\n\nChicago Funk Mafia \nThe derivation of the term Mafia is nebulous, but thought to originate from the arabic slang term \"mahyas\"-which means aggressive, proud, or boastful.",

The Chicago date will only be preceded by a Bladerunner performance at the Adelaide Festival in Australia in March of 2014. The music created by these gentlemen is something to experience first hand. It\u2019s not jazz, it\u2019s not rock, it\u2019s not funk, but all of these combined.\u201d\n\nBLADERUNNER (featuring Zorn / Laswell / Lombardo)\t\n\n\u201cJohn Zorn is an American avant-garde composer, arranger, producer, saxaphonist and multi-instrumentalist with hundreds of album credits as performer, composer and producer across a variety of genres including jazz, rock, hardcore, classical, surf, metal, klezmer, soundtrack, ambient and improvised music. Zorn has stated \u201cAll the various styles are organically connected to one another. I\u2019m an additive person \u2013 the entire storehouse of my knowledge informs everything I do.\u201d For Zorn \u201cComposing is more than just imagining music\u2014it\u2019s knowing how to communicate it to musicians. And you don\u2019t give an improviser music that\u2019s completely written out, or ask a classical musician to improvise. I\u2019m interested in speaking to musicians in their own languages, on their own terms, and in bringing out the best in what they do. To challenge them and excite them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBill Laswell ranks among the most prolific of modern musicians, being involved in hundreds of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. Laswell\u2019s music draws upon many different genres, most notably funk, various world music, jazz, dub and ambient styles. He has also played or produced music from the noisier, more aggressive end of the rock spectrum, such as hardcore punk and metal. Some of the acts Laswell has worked with include Method of Defiance, The Golden Palominos, Praxis, Massacre, Material, Buckethead, Painkiller, Ashes, Tabla Beat Science, Iggy Pop and Herbie Hancock.\u201d\n\n\u201cDave Lombardo is a Cuban American drummer and a co-founding member of the American thrash metal band Slayer. He performed with Slayer on seven albums, including their groundbreaking 1986 release Reign In Blood and their 2006 release Christ Illusion, for which he received critical praise. Lombardo\u2019s music career has spanned more than 25 years, during which he has been involved in the production of 29 commercial recordings extending over a number of genres with bands such as Grip Inc., Fant\u00f4mas, Philm, and Testament in addition to Slayer. Lombardo is most widely known as a very aggressive and exceptionally skilled heavy metal drummer. His use of the drums have been called \u201castonishingly innovative\u201d and earned him the title \u201cthe godfather of double bass\u201d from Drummer World. Over his career, he has had a significant influence on the metal scene and has inspired many modern metal drummers, particularly within both thrash metal and death metal.\u201d",

Rarely in the international goth-industrial scene does one hear about it. On May 1st, 2008, Jim Semonik, longtime promoter, DJ, and frontman for electro-industrial band Rein, was diagnosed with stage 2B colorectal cancer. During a rigorous campaign of chemotherapy and radiation, Semonik\u2019s passion for this music did not waver. On June 28th, 2008, 16 Volt\u2019s Denial Highway Tour came through Pittsburgh courtesy of Jim. It was at this event that Semonik formulated the idea for a compilation that would not only be gargantuan in scale, but in quality as well. Jim asked 16 Volt frontman, Eric Powell, to be a part of it. Eric didn\u2019t hesitate and thus Electronic Saviors was born.\n\nWhen a person is stricken with a disease like cancer, it is important for the individual to not only focus on beating the disease, but have a goal for how to do it. Electronic Saviors is Jim\u2019s way of not only giving back to the medical community that saved his life, but the goth-industrial community that he has so warmly embraced for the better half of his life. It is Jim\u2019s way of crushing cancer once and for all.\n\nIn fall/winter of 2008, Semonik lost a portion of his digestive system and had to undergo a grueling program of post op chemotherapy. Jim almost lost his life due to a pancreatic infection from the chemo. This made the compilation of utmost importance. After recovering he began contacting bands throughout the scene that he had worked with and shared a great relationship with. It was not long before bands like Suicide Commando, Assemblage 23, Chemlab, Caustic, and his own band Rein would begin to work on all exclusive tracks and mixes for what would become one of the biggest compilations the scene has ever seen.\n\nA grand total of 83 artists came together for this project, and it is with this that Jim wants to donate proceeds to the Center For Cancer Research and Wellness in Harrisburg, PA.\n\nSaviors is a monumental 4 cd boxset, packaged nicely in DVD digipack format, featuring stunning artwork by Jeff Confer and a 12 page booklet including an essay from Jim and a drop card for a downloadable 5th cd. The content of the compilation covers the widest range of emotions that a cancer patient goes through. It ranges from melancholy moving songs (ThouShaltNot, Bow Ever Down, Encoder) to songs about the medical industry (SMP, Boole) to angry songs of loss (Suicide Commando, Rein, Acumen Nation) to pure anger and raging dance tracks (Nachtmahr, The Dark Clan, TERRORFAKT, Vicious Alliance), downtempo, ambient and tranquil pieces (Burikusu!!!, The Atomica Project), comedic (The Gothsicles, Caustic) and songs of hope (Interface, SD6 and Assemblage 23).\n\nThe success of the Electronic Saviors Project far exceeded everyone's expectations by having completely selling out of all copies of Volume 1, it saw well attended and packed live ES benefit shows/ release parties and  raised over $20,000 for the foundation of Cancer Research and Wellness. Well we all know that Cancer returning is any survivor's nightmare so Metropolis Records, in association with Distortion Productions presented Electronic Saviors Vol 2:Recurrence. This is a 6 or 8 disc (whichever you ordered) box set of exclusive tracks by some of the biggest names in the industrial genre to raise money for cancer research. Cancer survivor and long time promoter and DJ, Jim Semonik, assembled 142 artists from around the world.\n\nThis compilation contained 105 (standard edition) and 142 (premium edition) tracks in total, including new exclusive tracks and mixes by 16 Volt, Project Pitchfork, Covenant, Blutengel, Suicide Commando, System Syn, God Module, Cesium 137, The Dark Clan, Rein[Forced], Mesh and many more. Packaged in a DVD style digipak containing the 6 physical CDs as well as a bonus 2 cd digipack with sticker, wristband and 70 page BRICKS survivors stories booklet. Proceeds from this Boxset were donated to the Gilda's Club/Cancer Support Community (http://www.gildasclub.org/) and The Bone Marrow Foundation (http://www.bonemarrow.org/) where Jim Semonik and the Electronic Saviors project raised over $10,000 for those foundations\n\nFast Forward to 2014 and ES3: Remission\u2026.. \"You are cured!\" These words are a dream come true to any cancer patient. Scene promoter, DJ and frontman of electro-industrial act Rein[Forced], Jim Semonik, returns to give the vile disease of cancer another pummeling with a ton of his friends, comrades, heroes and allies in Electronic Saviors 3:Remission. Jim, creator of the series, recently celebrated 5 years cancer free and is eager to share his gift with the world. Semonik once again returns with an armada of talent to shake dance floors and crush eardrums. Brand new and exclusive tracks from Combichrist, 16 Volt, Hate Dept, Stromkern, Rein[Forced], Panic Lift, Ego Likeness, Left Spine Down, Aesthetic Perfection and many, many more make Electronic Saviors 3 an essential purchase. Limited to 1000 copies, this volume is expected to sell out quickly and become a collector's item. The Electronic Saviors series continues to grow with this 3rd volume. Jim once again dedicates this volume to anyone who has been a victim of cancer in any way, shape or form.\n\nJoin us for this special event that boasts artists from the compilation (as well as a guest from ES2) as they all come together to help raise awareness on the subject and also to celebrate the strength and resolve that cancer survivors show. All proceeds from this unique live event will go directly to the Gilda's Club/Cancer Support Community. The first Electronic Saviors Benefit show that we put together in 2010 had a near capacity turnout and the second edition of the Chicago release party saw outstanding performances from Ego Likeness, The Gothsicles and Cryogen Second. We are pleased to announce the special addition of a ES2 boxset artist, Servitor, who absolutely destroyed with his live set recently while on tour with Ego Likeness. He goes on early but if there was ever a opening support artist that you had to see than Servitor drum would be it!  Yes this evening starts a little early but this event will fill to capacity quickly and we would hate to have to turn people away at the door for such a good cause so please plan your evening accordingly.\n\n IVARDENSPHERE:\niVardensphere: Singularity\nMany who have seen iVardensphere are familiar with the intensity the band puts into their tribal performance. There have been upwards of 8 drummers on stage at a time during their shows creating that familiar rhythmic 'wall of sound'. The band has two sides, however. \nScott Fox's Singularity focuses on the electronic side of the project. With an emphasis on improvisation and crunch, no Singularity performance with be a clone of a previous show. Featuring a table full of electronics and audio manglers with no laptop in sight, Singularity is a one man performance that contains the punchy energy of the large show in a logistically easier package. \nSingularity also operates with an open stage concept. Members of the audience are free to come up and have a look at what is going on. Nothing is being hidden. Stand beside Fox as the music is coming to life. No barricades. Even setting up right in the middle of the floor has happened.\nWith punch, sweeping ambience, gut shaking bass and close up integration with the fans, this show shouldn't be missed.\n(Take tribal drums, mix with pounding analogue synths and a killer club sound and what do you get? Welcome to iVardensphere. \n\nThe new album, APOK, finds iVardensphere exploring different aspects of their sound, from dance floor stomping powernoise to more exotic flavors of tribal drumming blended with elements of trip-hop and a club-pleasing analog synth bumping EBM sound. APOK, iVardensphere's first release on Metropolis Records, also takes iVardensphere's passion for collaborations to a whole new level, bringing in guest artists including I:Scintilla, Caustic, God Module, and This Morn' Omina as well as featuring remixes by SKOLD, ESA, releveleR and Pull Out Kings.\n\nThe story of iVardensphere's rise begins a few years ago in Edmonton, Canada, where Scott Fox DJs the notorious club nights SICK and Das OOntz. Fox took his expertise in filling the dance floor and applied it to his passion for synths and industrial dance music to create a fresh take on the genre to form iVardensphere. Upon being heard for the first time by Vancouver-based label Synthetic Sounds, iVardensphere was immediately signed and the debut album Scatterface was released in July 2009, mastered by Sebastian Komor [Icon of Coil]. \n\nSoon after the completion of Scatterface, Scott enlisted the talents of Chris Lacroix [aka Siborg from Virtual Terrorist] to help bring the project from the studio to the stage, where the band shines. Ever since, iVardensphere has been constantly active live, having performed with acts ranging from Apoptygma Berzerk to Iszoloscope to 16Volt and Chemlab to Front Line Assembly at such places as Das Bunker in LA and the Kinetik Festival in Montreal. Buoyed by touring and word of mouth from an ever-growing fan base, iVardensphere has steadily swept across the industrial dance club scene in North America.\n\nAt the end of 2009, Scatterface made its way across the Atlantic on one of Europe\u2019s leading darkrock and industrial labels, Danse Macabre Records, as Fox prepared iVardensphere's second release, Remixes Vol. 1, featuring remixes from Komor Kommando, Memmaker, Left Spine Down and others. Initially a digital-only release, fans demand CDs, and so Remixes vol. 1 came out in February 2010 on Synthetic Sounds. This release also marked iVardensphere's first introduction to the college radio charts across Canada. \n\nThe summer of 2010 saw the band hit a wide range of cities and venues all across the USA and Canada with Iszoloscope and ad*ver*sary, gaining loads of new fans. Word of their powerful live shows continued to spread and they were asked to open Combichrist's North American tour in the fall of 2010, just in time for a new album to hit.\n\niVardensphere\u2019s much anticipated second studio album, Bloodwater, came out in November of 2010, showcasing Fox's growing interest in using tribal drumming and other more organic sounds alongside electronics and samplers. Spurned on by club play and word of mouth from the band\u2019s performances on Monsters on Tour with Combichrist, Bloodwater smouldered up the Canadian college radio electronic charts, eventually spending three months on !earshot\u2019s national electronic charts in early 2011 and nine weeks on ChartAttack\u2019s electronic charts. It also received great reviews, including in Outburn Magazine and Rue Morgue. \n\nThe fall 2010 tour with Combichrist went so well that iVardensphere was asked to come out on tour with Combichrist again in the spring of 2011.\n\nWherever they roam, iVardensphere are always eager to collaborate with other artists, including working with Booming Tree Taiko on their first tour with Combichrist and trading remixes with the likes of Rotersand. Past collaborations with Iszoloscope went so well that iVardensphere recently announced that Iszoloscope's Yann Faussurier became a full-fledged member of iVardensphere at the end of 2010, and Fox, Faussurier and Lacroix wasted no time in starting work on APOK alongside their collaborators. iVardensphere recently grew again as Iszoloscope and Memmaker's Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Scarfone also joined the fold as an official member after previously exchanging remixes with iVardensphere as Katastroslavia and co-writing on APOK.\n\nThe band's continuing growth and solid sounds caught the interest of industrial/electro powerhouse label Metropolis Records, who have now welcomed iVardensphere into the fold to help foster further expansion.)\n\nREIN[FORCED]:\n\nRein[Forced] started in 2003 from the ashes of Pittsburgh based electro/industrial band Forced. Jim Semonik, aka Jimmy Semtex, was the only original member from the band left. Rather than breaking up, he decided to reboot the band while staying true to the sound of the first cd, Cherophobia(released on DSBP, 2002). Fellow local musicians D.A. Turner and Ben Bloom joined Semtex and decided that the second album would be a lot more personal. In early 2006, the second album, Futile Longings of a Condecending Man(DSBP, 2006) was released and Included the singles \"Waster\" and \"Hiatus\". The band also released a limited edition cdr entitled I Can't Be Responsible For Remixes under the original Forced name and sold it at shows. Cherophobia and Futile Longings are now sold out.\n\nFollowing the release of Futile Longings, Rein[Forced] faced the loss of keyboardist, programmer, Ben Bloom. The band was devastated. The band took some time off and in 2007, started writing the follow up to Futile Longings, entitled X Amount Of Stabwounds In the Back. New songs \"Nausea\" and \"Dichotomy\" started to be included in live sets. However, as work continued on the new album, Semonik was diagnosed with stage 2B colorectal cancer and the album was placed on hold until he recovered. Semonik went through a harsh chemo/radiation treatment and almost died from a pancreatitis attack. During this time he compiled the Electronic Saviors:Industrial Music To Cure Cancer and released it on Metropolis Records in February of 2010. Rein[Forced] contributed a remix of new track \"Malignancy\". Semonik has also collaborated with Cleveland's Encoder, the U.K.'s Uberbyte and Pittsburgh's Prometheus Burning as well as Mindless Faith, Patricia Wake and a new side project called Borderlines.\n\nIn 2010, work resumed on X Amount, and got the attention of Chicago's WTII Records. Combining catchy synth hooks and coldwave inspired lyrics and attitude, Rein[Forced] provides a unique take on the current electo/industrial and EBM scene. Focusing more on song writing rather than club tracks that would be easily forgotten, Rein[Forced] provides a new depth to a style that has become forgotten in today's club scene while providing dancy grooves that will be remembered for years to come.\n\nDichotomy was released on April 3rd of 2012 and was the first single from the highly anticipated Rein[Forced] album \"X Amount of Stab Wounds in the Back\". This digital only single featured 6 versions of the title track including mixes by Stiff Valentine, Sensuous Enemy, Ego Likeness, Deathproof and The Dark Clan plus a special b-side\n\n2013 saw the return of Rein[Forced] with the remix companion to last year's X Amount of Stab Wounds in the Back. Pre-existing Conditions is a 2xCD set that features 25 remixes and an unreleased b-side, a cover of Machines of Loving Grace's hit Butterfly Wings. Remixers for Pre-existing Conditions include Inertia, Society Burning, Stiff Valentine, Imperative Reaction, Die Sektor, Ego Likeness, I,Scintilla, Mindless Faith and many more.\n\nRein[Forced] has shared the stage with some heavy scene hitters such as Imperative Reaction, Aesthetic Perfection, Pigface, Hanzel Und Gretyl, Bella Morte, Ego Likeness, Celldweller, Funker Vogt, Haujobb, Assemblage 23, Project Pitchfork, Chemlab, Terrorfakt, Acumen Nation, Interface, My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult and Chris Connelly. Semonik has also appeared on recent releases by The Dark Clan and Sonik Foundry. Stay tuned, there is much more to come.\n\nCRYOGEN SECOND:\nHailing all the way from Nashville, industrial/electro outfit,Cryogen Second is a powerful entry to the world of dark electronics. Featuring Eric Sochocki ( All Studio programming and vocals) Kevin Edlin (live guitars) and Asli Tiner (Live Synths), Cryogen Second's 2011 full length \"Anthem for the Great Self Destruct\" on Beyond Therapy records contained crunchy synthetic loops, heavy-hitting hooks, slick production, and nods to modern metal that are contained in each track, with lyrics that evoke fatalism and a ponderence on the very futility that dominates the human condition. Probably best known for their club track \"Clarity\" which first saw the light of day in 2010 , and can be found with remixes from Metropolis recording artist, Caustic and also Level 2.0 on the self-released Clarity EP\n\nBut Cryogen Second is a completely different beast live. While the album and EP'S are riddled with influences from bands like Meshuggah, Fear Factory, The Deftones, Pneumatic Detach, Prodigy, and Psyclon Nine, the live presentation becomes the sum of these parts, incorporating live guitars, synthesizers, and showmanship into a frenetic performance that is more reminiscent of the energy of a late 90's punk show than a modern dance outfit. This band has shared the stage with both metal and electronic bands such as Assemblage 23, Faderhead, FGFC820, Bella Morte, Ludovico Technique, Common Man Down, God Module, Espermachine, Angels on Acid, Ego Likeness and could be just as easily at home in a mosh pit or a dance floor, often bridging the two disparate influences in the same song.\n\nCryogen Second are also gaining a strong reputation for their solid remixes, having just completed deconstructing songs by Caustic, Inure, Level 2.0, Stahlnebel and WTII Records very own, State of the Union!\n\nSTANDARD ISSUE CITIZEN:\nStandard Issue Citizen has been leaving its mark across the northeast and midwest US since 2007. Originally a project of frontman Tim Mizerak, the band has since grown to become a full-fledged act.\n\nThey have shared the stage with many great industrial acts including Aesthetic Perfection, Nachtmahr, The Ludovico Technique, Psyclon Nine, Dawn of Ashes, Hanzel und Gretyl, Slick Idiot, Mankind Is Obsolete, Espermachine, and more!\n\nTheir first CD, Your Opinion Is Forfeit, was released in December 2010. It features a collection of the band's early works and was mixed by Isaac Glendening of Cesium_137. It was soon followed by the free SICfuck EP in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, the band embarked on their first tour of both the northeast and midwest regions of the United States and released a new single \"Superhero\" featuring remixes from numerous rising talents in the industrial scene.\n\nNow, in 2014, Standard Issue Citizen has been selected to be a part of Electronic Saviors: Industrial Music to Cure Cancer Volume 3 and will continue playing shows all over the US as they prepare to release their next album, due late Summer 2014.\n\nNew single \"Signals of Distress\" out 4.15.2014! Download the Superhero single and SICfuck EP for FREE from standardissuecitizen.com!\n\nSERVITOR:\nServitor reflects the living resurrected earth springing back through the decay of the failed industrial machine of many cities. The living breathing pulsing drums, the grinding, rhythmic machine of industry.\nMembers-Servitor\n\nSound-Servitor combines live percussion with foundations in traditional West African, Afro Cuban, Middle Eastern, Brazilian, and American tribal drums with a heavy, diverse and rich background of grinding industrial programming. A screaming, pulsing, thundering, music experience that is a massive departure from the usual approach to rhythms in electronic music.\nLive Servitor\u2019s unique setup and approach allows for performances along with other artists. Servitor has performed live with dancers and has played drums for other acts. Servitor\u2019s music has been used for fusion/bellydance performance tracks poi/fire performances and independent commercial advertisements. The best way to get the live feel of Servitor\u2019s drums in a dance/fire performance is to bring Servitor and the drums on stage.\n\nFollowers- Servitor\u2019s unique sound, and heavy emphasis on drums has thundered through the underworld to bring out the most unexpected, but entirely welcome cadre of dancers, artists and misfits. Among the masses of Servitor dendrophants are the raq-ing, shimmy-ing belly dancer, the vintage-teching steampunk, the boot-stomping rivethead, the drum circling skin pounders, the footloose African dancer, Ren Faire geeks and SCA enthusiasts. The audience of a Servitor show is always diverse and overflowing with creative, artistic minds. It\u2019s impossible not to fit in.",

Denne sommeren gj\u00f8r du faktisk Ikke det, for selveste CHICAGO kommer til Langesund og Wrightegaarden!\n\nVi snakker om bandet som av eks-president Bill Clinton ble omtalt som det viktigste bandet siden de fant opp rock n roll. Bandet som er det eneste amerikanske bandet som har v\u00e6rt p\u00e5 topp 40 listene over beste album i seks ti\u00e5r p\u00e5 rad. Ja, akkurat det Chicago er det vi snakker om.\n\nFor godt til \u00e5 v\u00e6re sant sier du? Nei da. Som eneste norske konsertscene tar vi i mot Chicago i sommer, og vi gj\u00f8r det forh\u00e5pentligvis for en stappfull Wrightegaarden-hage.\n\nChicago best\u00e5r fortsatt av medlemmer fra den originale besetningen som Robert Lamm, Lee Loughnane, James Pankow og Walt Parazaider. Med seg i bandet har de ogs\u00e5 Jason Scheff, Tris Imboden, Keith Howland, Lou Pardini og Wally Reyes. Dette er bandets 46 \u00e5r p\u00e5 rad med turneer, og de har fortsatt ikke utsatt en eneste konsertdato. Det m\u00e5 vel ogs\u00e5 v\u00e6re en eller annen form for rekord?\n\nVi klarer nesten ikke sitte stille n\u00e5r vi tenker p\u00e5 at slagere som If you leave me now, You\u00b4re the inspiration, Hard to say i\u00b4m sorry og Saturday in the park, i tillegg til flere slagere og en rekke helt nye l\u00e5ter, vil ljome utover hagen og Langesund fredag 18. juli.",

This has given him the ability to speak directly to you through the computer, a miracle you will only now come to fully appreciate:\n\nMy Name Is Tiga. Welcome to the Bio-Dome, mec!\n\nAs you know, my remix work has slowed considerably as of late. While my versions of tracks by Alter Ego, New Young Pony Club, The Gossip and Human League have only enhanced my reputation as the Sex Whiz of Sonic Parkour, I felt I needed to start hoarding my best ideas for my own music. The remix of Alter Ego\u2019s \u201cGary\u201d, for instance, forced me to cannibalize much of the work I\u2019d done in my now-legendary sessions with Bobby McFerrin. It was then that I knew that I had to draw the line.\n\nThe seeds for ZZT, my ongoing collaboration with Zombie Nation, when we hit it off at the semi-biannual Gigolo High-Earners Galmour Pageant and Hot Meal. After falling out with Gigolo over accusations of cyber-arson, I approached him about working together, possibly on music. I soon came to love his thing-throwing, humor-having ways. Our tracks tend to be \u201clive\u201d in nature, in that we try to only use parts that require four hands at a time. Or 19 fingers and three lips. It depends.\n\nRainier Werner Bassfinder takes everything great about my work with Jesper Dahlback and takes it to a new level. One that forces me to use a fake name. I chose the moniker \u201cThe Dove\u201d for reasons contractual and shame-based. Probably 70/30, contract/shame. Oh, Michael Gothard, I only wanted to do right by you!\n\nOver the past few years, I have continued to tour the globe extensively. I have eaten Club Sandwiches in over 60 countries and done \u201cThe Sandwich\u201d in over 600 clubs. I was also brave enough to visit the Middle East, with a harrowing trip to war-ravaged Dubai. I was taken falconing (this is 100 percent true), which was strange enough before I found out that the falcons undergo extensive plastic surgery to look more like celebrities. My falcon, I was told, was supposed to resemble Ethan Hawke. I don\u2019t know who that is.\n\nThe past few years have also seen a resurgence at my record label, Turbo. The work done by Thomas Von Party in A&R and Oliver Interactive in International Business Affairs has been invaluable. I can\u2019t express how much I appreciate their efforts in making Turbo the Towerhorse it is today. I would be remiss, however, in not mentioning the real star of the show, our Branding Consultant, Brandon Branding.\n\nBrandon saw ways of expanding our brand in new and exciting directions. He insisted I start participating in community soccer leagues to lend an \u201ceveryman\u201d quality to my daunting brilliance. I was skeptical at first, but soon I came to treasure seeing the faces of 50-year-old men in goggles light up as I take the field. I am a defense-minded, vaguely passive-aggressive midfielder, and have trained online with Ghana international Michael Essien.\n\nMr. Branding also encouraged me to write for the label, birthing a torrid run of press sheets that has sparked in me a love of letters deep and true. Now I write all the time. I even replaced my car\u2019s paneling with dry-erase board, so that I may lean out the driver\u2019s seat window at a moment\u2019s notice to scrawl away at the face of literature.\n\nToday, our reach extends even further, thanks to my venturing into the world of amateur inventing. There\u2019s the Grocery Claw, aimed at those who rightly abhor what I call Market Filth. And, with an eye towards the future of our planet, Solar-Powered Wind.\n\nMost importantly, 2009 will see the release of my new LP, \u201cCiao!\u201d This album will surely cement my status as a Storytella and Funky Fella. \u201cCiao!\u201d is the fruit of 15 months of collaborations with such leading lights as Soulwax, Jesper Dahlback, Gonzales, Jori Hulkonnen, Jake Shears and James Murphy. An impressive roster, to say the least. What was that? What do you mean, \u201cWhat?\u201d That sound you just made! It was like a snort, a dismissive snort. have you worked with, then, genius? Sting Jr.? That weirdo form Simply Red? Lady Sting? I am not impressed in the least.\n\nAll in all, at the end of the day, I can\u2019t help but gaze into the reflecting pool and think to myself, \u201cI guess I really turned the night on, huh?\u201d\n\n1976 \u2013 2003, \u201cThe Creation Myth\u201d\n\u201cThe citizen may take a bride, but it is the rifleman who takes a lover. Ultimately we all must choose either the myth or the mountain.\u201d\n\nThe origins of Montreal born DJ-producer-incipient Teutonic legend Tiga lie to the vague and troubling East, where he was weaned on the nefarious milk of the notorious 1980s Indian club scene.\u201cTo the unforgiving eye,\u201d he says of the sybaritic night-kingdom,\u201ca world of filth and decadence is revealed. For example, I\u2019m fairly certain that more than a few club owners had an unsavory arrangement with the man who brought the folding chairs. I was at once appalled and enraptured. After that, I had no choice in the matter.\u201d\n\nBy 1990, Tiga had returned to Montreal, prodigiously nightwise and unsatisfied with the existing local club scene (calling it \u201cthe plumage of a bird I cannot bring myself to want.\u201d) With the help of a core group of friends, he began to throw a series of small parties infused with the sense of dead-eyed ennui gleaned from a past littered with acid whores and crazed Indian gamblers. Other innovations which Tiga introduced to Montreal party culture include guest DJs, intense street promotions featuring rival gangs of street acrobats, color flyers, multi-dj sets, and leading the supplicant crowd through the innermost corridors of one\u2019s soul.\n\nIt was this heady time of dizzying innovation and ravenous sexual ambition, which culminated in the birth of 1993\u2019s \u201cSolstice,\u201d generally, considered to be Montreal\u2019s first genuine rave. (A year earlier, a hyper-prescient Tiga staged \u201cEclectricity,\u201d the first online rave, a project whose utter failure remains a source of bafflement: \u201cIt broke my heart, given my views on diversity . . . I am, I feel, a very interactive person.\u201d) Tiga has since helped to orchestrate no less than ten major events, including \u201cThe Orb Live,\u201d \u201cPure,\u201d and the very first North American appearance of continental illusionist Jean-There.\n\nIn 1994, Tiga bought DNA Records, a small medical data concern, and parlayed it into Montreal\u2019s premiere electronic music boutique. \u201cWe\u2019ve always believed in putting the customer first, from helping you find that one minimal house record that will make your collection to offering concerned looks as you wade through the enormous backlog of test results to discover if you are in fact afflicted with a congenital disease.\u201d\n\nIn 1996, Tiga privately sang about the death of actor and poet Tupac Shakur.\nThat same year, the Montreal dance community found a haven for the boldest feats of dance, where fools are in love with mystery and sex-valor is prized above all else. Sona (meaning literally \u2018Liar-dancer\u2019) was initially conceived of by Tiga and his two partners as \u201ca perverse, jeering monolith, because nothing is sacred anymore\u201d but it has evolved into much more. In addition to its place among the pantheon of urban groove centers, on weekdays it rents out its facilities, at a very reasonable rate, to a local program dedicated to teaching homeless men to dance properly (\u201cI just think it\u2019s an important project,\u201d Tiga said at the time).\n\nIn 1998, Tiga started Turbo Recordings as an outlet for his wildman organ escapades but he soon found a host of other artists who were willing to be paid to record for him. Turbo has released over 20 albums, 2 samplers, and 12 vinyl twelve inches as well as secured global distribution with Prime, Intergroove and Caroline. Notable releases include Peter Benisch\u2019s \u201cSoundtrack Saga,\u201d Christopher Handlebar\u2019s \u201cTo a Time of Asia\u201d and Tiga\u2019s own \u201cMixed Emotions\u201d and \u201cAmerican Gigolo\u201d\n\nBy 2001, however, overwork and media saturation began to show their strain, as evidenced by Tiga\u2019s hysterical outburst at a fashion photographer during a promo shoot:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll sit for your venal cigarette pictures, but I will not indulge you in your game of \u2018Eyes! Lies! Surprise!\u2019 I dare you, coward\u2014call out your cloakmen! What are you waiting for? The truth?!\u201d\n\nFollowing a month spent riding horses and caring for his voice, Tiga entered the studio with producer Zyntherius \u201cJori\u201d Hulkonnen and a singular vision: \u201celectro, but mainly about my eyes.\u201d The result, a searing rendition of his former Mother Mio bandmate Corey Hart\u2019s solo smash \u201cSunglasses at Night,\u201d challenged dancers and seduced critics alike, yet Tiga is coy when asked about its impact, particularly in Germany: \u201c\u2019Sunglasses\u2019 is a sinless child, a gleaming medallion. But is also a trick, a trick of memory. You must understand \u2013 on a whim, we revealed the hidden fire of Europe.\u201d\n\nBut fires need tending and lumber. And so the onslaught of Tiga-powered releases was fated to continue. They are his craft, his life, his living craft-fire.\n\n\u201cWe live in the Age of Cruelty and every day I struggle to find my place in it. All I know I can offer the world is a thousand more adventures through dancing and light.\u201d\n\n2003 \u2013 2006, \u201cGet on Top of the Fire\u201d\nIf \u201cSunglasses at Night\u201d marked Tiga\u2019s coronation as the steely Wolf-King of Dance Mountain, then his subsequent remixes for the likes of Martini Bros., Alpinestars, Linda Lamb, Crossover, FC Kahuna, Cabaret Voltaire, Telepopmusik, Felix da Housecat, Fischerspooner, FPU, The Devils (Nick Rhodes), and Danni Minogue birthed his dewy-eyed heir, Darian. Says Tiga, \u201cI have also produced remixes for City Rockers, and singles for Turbo Recordings, Intec, Drumcode, and Electrix with Mateo Murphy under the name TGV. I am also the hidden hero of the ongoing NHL lockout. I will break the players\u2019 will \u2013 you have my solemn word.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, Tiga took his conqueror\u2019s tools to the streets, with a heralded mix CD for !K7\u2019s DJ Kicks series, and an ethereal reading of Nelly\u2019s \u201cHot in Herre,\u201d which became a stalwart success and was subsequently licensed in the UK by Skint (in the UK) and Warner Music (the GAS region). The video, which can be seen at http://www.eyeballnyc.com/tiga, is a revelation of neo-urban dazzle-do, courtesy of the puppet wizardry of Tiga\u2019s brother, the Lord of the Marionette (www.lordofthemarionette.com).\n\nTiga was also gracious enough to lend his wind-shattering vocals to Richard X\u2019s \u201cYou (Better Let Me Love YouX4) Tonight,\u201d as well as \u201cHeartbreak/Ananda,\u201d by Beyer & Lenk (Adam Beyer and Jesper Dahlback), and Rik Stamina\u2019s \u201cDancing Inside You.\u201d His remix work on Alex Kidd\u2019s \u201cCome With Me\u201d, Neon Judgement\u2019s \u201cTV Treated,\u201d Scissor Sisters\u2019 cover of Pink Floyd\u2019s \u201cComfortably Numb,\u201d \u201cDa Hype,\u201d by Junior Jack and Robert Smith, and Peaches\u2019 \u201cShake Yer Dix,\u201d and Soulwax\u2019s \u201cE Talking\u201d comprises a merciless Crimson Romance, lapping at the shores of eternity.\n\nTiga\u2019s smash single \u201cPleasure From The Bass\u201d, a two-fisted jackal that drew a line in the dancefloor sand, was released in 2004 on the Belgian imprint PIAS.\n\n2005 saw remixes for Depeche Mode, The Vests, Moby, LCD Soundsystem, Mylo, Phillipe Zdar, Chelonius Jones, Drama Society, Thomas Andersson and countless others. In October, Tiga womanized the world with \u201cYou Gonna Want Me\u201d, his toothsome duet with Jake Shears (of Scissor Sisters\u2019 fame), \u201cOnce again, I proved you can\u2019t spell \u2018sword\u2019 without \u2018words\u2019\u201d says the dance-freckled Disco Jockler.\n\n2006 began with the release of Tiga\u2019s debut album Sexor, which sounded the clarion call of an emergent Nation-Man. \u201cIt is an exhilarating time \u2013 the woes and the whoas, the thrills and the throes! Like Icarus, I have flown dangerously close to the fun, on a dare to wear my overalls undone.\u201d\nTiga then embarked on the \u201cSexor over Europe\u201d and \u201cSexor over Canada\u201d tours in a manner befitting The Most Compassionate Man Alive. \u201cSoon I will position Sexor over America and Sexor over Japan, forcing rapt smiles onto the faces of the discovantaged, those fey, oblivious costumers\u2019 sons\u2026\u201d, he said.\n\nThat same year, Tiga made you go \u201cTig-unnggghh!\u201d with the video for the single, \u201c(Far From) Home.\u201d Shot in Tokyo, the clip follows Tiga on a soul-laughening journey down a street of some sort. The video was helmed by Nagi Noda, the accalimed Japanese director of the groundbreaking music video for Yuki\u2019s \u201cSentimental Journey\u201d, a short film, Ex Fat Girl, which features exercising poodles, and projects for Nike and Laforet, for which she has won a host of prizes in Japan, not the least of which being Tiga\u2019s coveted \u201cAdmiration-in-Japan\u201d Medal.\n\nMeanwhile, the \u201c(Far From) Home\u201d single left mankind fitted for underjeans, provocatively asking listeners \u201cAre you a DoJ or a Don\u2019tJ?\u201d The release included remix work by the DFA, Digitalism, and Chicken Lips, showcasing Tiga\u2019s incredibly exotic voice in new sonic locales, as well as a remix by Tiga himself, \u201cThe Speed of Sexor Reprise.\u201d A well-meaning dub edit by Jon Aerosmith & Eduardo B. Rich was politely declined.\n\nTiga\u2019s reign of wonder continued to not stop, as he dutifully drew up the dance contracts for tracks by Coldcut and Pet Shop Boys. \u201cAs both a student \u2013 and a significant part \u2013 of history, I feel it would be a betrayal of my stewardship to ever remix music in anger. It is not the Way of the Musician, nor is it the Musician\u2019s Way.\u201d\n\n\nABOUT GREEN VELVET\nChange has been a constant theme throughout the successful career of Green Velvet, but as he has crossed genres, explored themes from the comedic to the serious and changed monikers, the common thread running through the music he has made for nearly two decades is its roots in and dedication to the Chicago House sound.\n\nHis first transformation came when he left master\u2019s degree studies in chemical engineering at UC-Berkeley to turn a hobby into a career making music, influenced by the sounds he had been exposed to as a science-fiction-loving, video-game-playing kid whose father was a part-time Chicago DJ.\n\nAs Cajmere, he released his inaugural Underground Goodies EP in 1991 on his Cajual label, keeping true to the early House sound. He quickly followed it up the next year with the smash hit \u201cCoffeepot (It\u2019s Time for the Percolator).\u201d\n\nNot one to rest on his success, he soon changed things up, teaming with vocalist Dajae for \u201cBrighter Days,\u201d a more mellow House tune, this one released by Emotive. That pairing would be his last with a female vocalist until his recent partnership with rapper Kid Sister for \u201cEverybody Wants.\u201d\n\nThe 17 years in between those two projects witnessed an incredible array of electronic music emanating from this prolific artist, as well as a second label under his direction, Relief. Adopting the persona Green Velvet (not to mention a Day-Glo shock wig) for his techno-oriented pieces and DJ appearances, he became the champion of new wave Chicago beats through the \u201990s-known best for hits such as \u201cPreacher Man,\u201d \u201cFlash\u201d (a No. 1 U.S. dance hit in 1995), and 1997\u2032s laugh-inducing \u201cAnswering Machine.\u201d The decade ended with his first album, Constant Chaos in 1999.\n\nThe new century brought a compilation album, Green Velvet, during a brief signing with Warner Bros. Records\u2019 short-lived F-111 imprint, and a production album, Whatever, on Relief. The punk-inspired Whatever explored darker themes than his previous work, including racism (\u201cWhen?\u201d), drug use (\u201cGenedefekt\u201d and \u201cLa La Land\u201d), alienation (\u201cSleepwalking\u201d) and bending to authority (\u201cGat\u201d).\n\n\u201cLa La Land\u201d went on to become by far the biggest selling track of his career. His live act expanded as he began playing a keytar, with two other musicians-Nazuk and Spaceboy-backing him, playing heavily distorted synths.\n\nThe last decade also saw Green Velvet become a fan favorite across Europe, playing to huge crowds at festivals in addition to live radio appearances and club gigs. Numerous side projects and remixes under various names also added to his seemingly nonstop musical output.\nIn 2005, Green Velvet released his third album, Walk In Love, which stayed true to the House sound, with a few pop- and punk-oriented tracks for good measure, including \u201cCome Back\u201d and \u201cPin-Up Girl,\u201d both of which featured a live guitarist.\n\nThe ongoing evolution in the music, career and life of the artist born Curtis Alan Jones in Chicago has been and will continue to be fascinating to watch and experience for his many followers.\n\nOver the past seven year\u2019s Green Velvet has released some of his most beloved anthems, including \u201cShake and Pop\u201d, \u201cEverybody Wants\u201d, \u201cMilli Vanilli\u201d. Riding the wave of critical acclaim and success, Green Velvet has been touring the globe stopping at some of the most respected clubs and festivals along way.\n\nIn addition to his solo work, he has been collaborating with some of underground dance music\u2019s most respected and popular producers, including Maceo Plex, Jamie Jones, Danny Tenaglia, Pleasurekraft, Phil Kieran, Carl Craig, Derrick Carter, Crookers and DJ Sneak.",

Along with Attalla, Space Miami residents Cocodrills will be flying up from South Beach to make a special appearance in the Windy City.  Opening the night is Chicago favorite and Spybar resident, Dustin Sheridan.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nANTHONY ATTALLA\nIncorrect Music // Chicago, IL\n\nAs we enter 2014, Anthony Attalla has firmly established himself as a rising star in the electronic music community.  His personal growth in the studio as a producer and on stage as a performer has the industries biggest taste makers, as well as its biggest publications, proclaiming that Anthony is set to break out in the coming year.  Never resting on his laurels, Anthony has also demonstrated his passion for the business side of the industry by creating a platform to showcase his favorite talent through Incorrect Music, his music production-company, which has proven to be a most successful endeavor.  \n\nAs an artist, Anthony has charted over 50 Top 100 tracks on Beatport.com, the widely popular outlet for purchasing Dance Music.  With popular labels such as Sony, Atlantic, Warner Bros, Ultra, and Toolroom seeking his productions as well as underground heavyweights Suara, Great Stuff, 1605, Trapez, Tronic, Break New Soil, MBF, and Stereo Recordings, Attalla has become a wanted man.  In addition, the demand for his live performance has grown to an all-time high with continuous touring throughout the United States, as well as international bookings in Europe, Ibiza, Mexico & Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Canada.  Furthermore, Anthony made his mark this summer on the White Isle (Ibiza, Spain) as he was asked to support Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso on their newly formed 'Departures' project.  The residency at the uber exclusive Ushuaia Hotel & Pool showcased the world's most in-demand talent and is arguably Ibiza's hottest ticket.\n\nNow surpassing its three-year anniversary, Incorrect Music has experienced success at an alarming pace.  The label\u2019s achievements include having tracks played and charted by some of the industries\u2019 most credible artists, boasting over 70 Top 100 tracks on various Beatport Charts, and spreading its wings globally with artists from more than 20 different countries making up its impressive roster.\n\nWith Anthony\u2019s multi-faceted approach to an increasingly demanding industry, he illustrates his ability to evolve and achieve as he continues to make his meteoric rise in international dance scene.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCOCODRILLS\nIncorrect Music // Miami, FL\n\nWhere they're from or how they grew up is entirely irrelevant. When they started off and what their influences were are inconsequential. Listing the popular venues they've played or name dropping artist that support them would be disingenuous. This is because a short anecdotal paragraph loaded with DJ/producer cliches wouldn't do their style, or their sound, any justice. The Cocodrills (Christian \"Pridef\" Diaz, Adam Cruz) pride themselves on creating a unique musical experience, which can only be just that; experienced. But make sure to leave your pretense at the door 'cause you won't find any bullshit at one of their parties; only funky grooves, positive vibes and rampant debauchery.

Our free programs create a safe community for individuals to come together as they enter new challenges of adulthood with epilepsy. Our mission is simple: no one should stand alone.\n\nHaving struggled with epilepsy since the age of 7, I look back and wish there had been times in my rocky journey in which I could've related to someone going through a similar experience. This is why we are here and have created something lacking in the Chicago community. I am proud to be a part of this effort. \n\nHere is the link to purchase tickets or donate to the event. We do have an early bird ticket price that ends today so grab 'em now!! \n\nhttp://epilepsychicago.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.event&eventID=554 \n\nThe early bird ticket price of $75 ($85 regular beginning March 13) includes heavy appetizers, beer, wine and a signature cocktail, dancing, DJ, \"fake\" gambling money and some awesome raffles to bid on. Come dressed in cocktail attire, ready for a red carpet photo opp! \n\nIf you have questions, msg me or email at msultemeier@epilepsychicago.org \n\nThank you for your support. \n\nLove,\nMaria",

Solotroff is also known as the vocalist in the doom/shoegaze band Anatomy of Habit. In The Fortieth Day, Reyes and Solotroff utilize guitar, bass, drum machine, and analog synthesizer to create epic, blackened, psychedelic-industrial drone soundscapes, likened to \"sustained, withering blasts of high-pitched noise that are as distinct from one another as spotlights sweeping across the night sky; jackhammer clatter, jet-engine whines, and forlorn keyboard melodies dart in and out of those huge sounds with the grace and impunity of plovers picking a crocodile's teeth\" [Bill Meyer, Chicago Reader]\nAs always for their live performances, the duo will be joined by video artist Lisa Slodki, performing under her Noise Crush moniker. Slodki is is also known for her exhibition and performance series with Chicago trio, Haptic, held at the UBS 12 x 12 Gallery in the Museum of Contemporary Art. Slodki utilizes a battery of VCRs and small video monitors, along with a video mixer and a projector, to present a seamless flow of black and white, primarily abstract, manipulated and looped found footage, resulting in a visual program that emphasizes subtle emotions and gestures and that perfectly compliments the music performed by The Fortieth Day.\n\nBRUCE LAMONT\nBruce Lamont joined Yakuza in February of 2000 and since the group has recorded four full lengths including their latest release \"transmutations.\" In July of 2006 he made his debut solo performance using a looper pedal and effects along with saxophones, guitar, voice, harp, and percussion.",

So he fights to keep all people coming together in the love of music and expanding Mines staying on course.

BOBBY\nElectro/React/Blacklight blackout/Custom Vibes/Front312/Chicago\nMr. Bobby was introduced to the dj/party world through his older brother. He began his musical career promoting for L.I.E. and MAYHEM in the late 90s. Promptly moving on to collaborate with others to form Profound Image containing crowds of around 1000 people. After a good few years he went on to form Profound Music on his own focused on Punk shows. He would also help put together festivals, block parties, art shows and much more. For a short time he formed The Androide Kult with a few others. Not having a DJ name he was dubbed Mr. Bobby. He then moved on to work with many different people who had the same drive to organize events and entertain people with good music. He has worked with Kompute Musik. For a brief period he worked with a few others to have the MYOUR HOUSE parties. He is still currently one of Custom Vibes and is now in the React family.\n   Bobby's own music has been on the works for a while as he has collaborated with many musicians. His style jumps from industrial, electronic, ambient, electro, to techno and a touch of Goth.\n   When you see him out mixing he can truly try to accommodate to what will make the people move. You can see that throughout his entire life he has been affected by all types and all styles from house, Goth, Indie, Punk, Electro, to the never ending genres the music will grow into. He tries to blend different genres with same sounds together to create his own concoction of sound. His favorite quote is \"my life is music and music is life\".\nMIX:https://soundcloud.com/mrbobby\n\n\u2605FUNSIZE\nBreaks&Electrohouse/Source Productions/DAyONE/Chicago\nadjective: fun-size\n 1.

This will be #3 under my belt :)\n2011-Milwaukee Brewers \n2013- St. Louis Cardinals \n2014- CHICAGO WHITE SOX!!! :)\n\nBut I, again, need your help! I have to sell 750 tickets to the game! They are $25 a piece for a great Saturday night game! \n****THESE TICKETS ARE NORMALLY $55 SEATS!!!!!****\nALSO, There will be a possibly incentive to the person who buys the most seats :) They can win box seats to another home game!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nSaturday August 30th, 6:00PM\nChicago White Sox vs Detroit Tigers \n@ US CELLULAR FIELD - Chicago, IL\n\nHOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK:\n-Tickets are $25 a piece. \n-According to the White Sox rules, I need to have the money in my hand before I can get your tickets printed out for you. Which means every 100 or so tickets I sell, I will be placing an order with the White Sox for these tickets. \nSo as a warning, you may have to wait a month before i can get your tickets sent out to you. \n-I can take cash, money order, moneygram, or paypal for payment. Will also charge standard rate of shipping to ship them back to you. \n-NO REFUNDS\n\nIF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS, I CAN GET YOU IN TOUCH WITH MY WHITE SOX REP.",

N\u00e5 er de klare for GT Bluesklubb!\n\u25ba En felles interesse for den gode, gamle Chicago-bluesen f\u00f8rte dette bandet sammen i 1996. Repertoaret speiler utviklingen fra akustisk deltablues til elektrisk \u201dstorbyjungel\u201d. Med CDen \u201dRockin\u2019 Feet\u201d (1998) viste bandet at det heller ikke skorter p\u00e5 originalitet og eget l\u00e5tmateriale. Chicago Bound leverer varene r\u00e5tt, svingende og bl\u00e5tt. Bandnavnet har de for \u00f8vrig l\u00e5nt fra en Jimmy Rogers l\u00e5t fra 50-tallet.\n\u25ba Vokalist og bassist Frode Larsen har fartstid fra bluesbandet Larsen\u2019s Last Chance og har de senere \u00e5rene hovedsakelig spilt i Patey\u2019s Pipe, samt en del freelance-jobbing. Under eget navn har han gitt ut platene: \u201dJukeboxman\u201d(2002) og \u201dHard Luck And Trouble\u201d(2007).\n\u25ba Kurt Slevingen er en intens og s\u00e6rdeles sjelfull gitarist. Han er i besittelse av solide kunnskaper om de forskjellige blues-stilartene og gir alt n\u00e5r han st\u00e5r p\u00e5 scenen. Han startet bandet Blue Soul i Bergen p\u00e5 80-tallet, og litt senere begynte samarbeidet med munnspiller Eirek Sandnes i Bluebirds og Oslo Bluesband, f\u00f8r Chicago Bound oppsto i 1996. Debutskiva, \u201dWest Side From The East Side\u201d, kom i 2002.\n\u25ba Raufossingen Eirek Sandnes er en veteran i milj\u00f8et og anses av mange \u00e5 v\u00e6re Norges fremste bluesmunnspiller. Denne mannen er en virtuoso p\u00e5 sitt instrument og har bl\u00e5st bl\u00e5toner i band som Vidar Busk , Knut Reiersrud Band , Sunnyland Slim, Sven Zetterberg , Jaybirds, Sugar Daddies, Little Itch og Oslo Bluesband. Samtidig som han er en suveren eksponent for munnspill-tradisjonen til Little Walter Jacobs/Kim Wilson, behersker han ogs\u00e5 til fulle et mer akustisk sound ala Sonny Boy Williamson II.\n\u25ba Espen A. Moen har gjennom mange \u00e5rs turnering med et utall av artister og band, etablert seg som en av Norges mest etterspurte blues-trommiser. Listen over freelance-oppdrag er lang, og han er ogs\u00e5 fast medlem av Tiger City Jukes og Eagle Ridin\u2019 Papas.",

        "description": "This August Justin and Chris return to the windy city for some mid-western therapeutic bliss. Give your body and being the gift of learning to give and receive, immersed in the world of yoga, flying therapeutics, Thai massage and other bodywork modalities. Harness the power of gravity and explore new freedoms in three-dimensional healing touch. Relax into the rejuvenating power of supportive community... Come fly with us!\n\nThis immersion teaches valuable tools for yoga teachers, massage therapists and physical therapists who want to develop their capacity to heal using their hands, and fulfills one of the prerequisites for the AcroYoga Teacher Training. This event also qualifies for 30 contact hours as part of the One Yoga USA TT and Yoga 4 Love Advanced Trainings; a certificate of completion will be given at the end of the 5 days. No previous experience or partner necessary. This training is for everybody; you do not have to be a yogi or have practiced acro.\n\nTo Register: \nhttp://clients.mindbodyonline.com/ws.asp?studioid=520&stype=-101&sView=day&sTrn=100000074\n\nQuestions: chris@acroyoga.org, 570.460.6824\n\nLocation:\n3113 North Lincoln Avenue Chicago, IL 60657\n\nInvestment:\nFull 5 days Early-Bird until July 23rd: $435\nFull 5 days from July 24th on: $535\nSaturday only day rate: $108\n\nSchedule:\nSat - Wed 10am - 5:30pm\n\nWhat is AcroYoga?\nAcroYoga blends the wisdom of yoga, the dynamic power of acrobatics, and the loving kindness of healing arts. These three lineages form the foundation of a practice that cultivates trust, playfulness, and community. In this immersion we will focus on the Lunar Healing Arts Practices that cultivate listening, loving and letting go and Yogic Practices that cultivate breathe awareness, life balance and connection.\n\nAcroYoga is a space to:\n\n- Heal the body\n- Learn to massage both on the floor and in the air\n- Play with freedom\n- Connect profoundly both with both yourself and with friends\n- Break the barriers of what you believe impossible\n- Conquer gravity\n- Take off in flight\n- Join the world community of AcroYoga\n\u2026 and smile a ton!\n\n\nAbout Justin Caruso:\nJustin feels the body to be a reflection of life: an ecstatic temple, a work of art, and a vehicle for connection. Just before the financial crisis Justin made a timely exit from Wall Street to return to yoga, a practice he began over fifteen years ago. A New York native, Justin has spent the past seven years traveling extensively through South America, Asia and the US, teaching and studying yoga, AcroYoga, bodywork and water therapies with many of the world's master teachers of the healing arts.\n\nAbout Chris Loebsack:\nChris Loebsack 500hr E-RYT uses the power of yoga to create space for students that cultivates trust playfulness and connection within themselves and their communities. Living by her mantra, Clarity, Integrity and Love, she draws upon her AcroYoga Practice to share the healing power of touch and safe intimacy. She is a valuable mentor to many upcoming educators. \n\nTestimonials:\n\n\"Thank you for such an incredible experience you just facilitated. You are gifted teachers, really. The material was presented with such ease; in an accessible, thorough, as well as FUN way! The healing that came from Thai Massage ( every morning ), and the playful laughter from flight; I truly feel nourished, inspired, and transformed. My deepest gratitude.\"\n\n\"Thank YOU for passing on and spreading your beautiful loving Energy. I missed going to the immersion this morning. Even though i went back to the same routine as before, today was a different day. Eternally grateful for having the opportunity to be your student for a few days.\nMany more will come. Muchas bendiciones y mucho amor\"\n\n\"Still riding so high on the waves of love shared at the lunar immersion in Miami! I am left with so many images from that weekend that make me weep from the pure beauty and loving that was embodied so perfectly in yourself, Chris, Ari and Lau! You've touched me profoundly and inspired me deeply! HUGE gratitude...thank you!\"\n\n\"I am singing praises for the connectedness and receptivity that I was blessed to experience this past week. Weaving threads of trust and surrender into one mandala of supreme symmetry, balance, and love. Learning how to allow my inner light to sink deeper into a space that homes boundless expansion. If we can move with ease and grace in our lives with an open accepting unconditional love for ourselves, only then can we truly give love to others. I am a conduit of radiance that is open to shine and was born to shine. Thank you from the bottom of my heart Chris Loebsack and Justin Caruso for awakening these gems of wisdom within me. I will never forgot our Lunar Immersion together and the beautiful sangha that was created. Endless gratitude to the divine healing in AcroYoga\"\n\n\n\"Last year, when I saw the amazing cast of great teachers that was going to teach this immersion I decided wholeheartedly to dive in. I rest reassured that that was one of the best ways to start 2013. I'm deeply inspired by where you have taken your practice (and where it has taken you) and feel grateful for how generous is your desire to share it. As it is with those souls that inject one's life with the substance of spiritual growth, I rest comfortably assured that there will be more opportunities for sharing the same space and share some love.\"\n\n\"Justiiiiiiiiin GRACIASSSS! THANK YOUUU! It was a truly amazing experience. I joined the Lunar Immersion to put myself outside of my comfort zone. At first I thought I was just going to be a spectator not having any experience but your teaching techniques were flawless and I very quickly felt like I was part of it all. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the aspect of giving in Acro Yoga I had a very big need to channel my need to give in a loving and nurturing way. Receiving was too much to handle! (No words to describe) The whole experience filled me with a renewed energy. My students have not stoped commenting that I look so happy. It was such a great investment. I still don't have the confidence to fly them or try any of the techniques but I do have my 6 yr old daughter and she is my little person to practice with. I still have to keep learning so for now I will continue to study as much Acro yoga as I can.

After three years of work apart, the critically acclaimed and multiple award winning duo of Josh Gabriel and Dave Dresden are back together with a new energy and spirit. \n\nIn 2001, Josh and Dave joined forces under the now legendary Gabriel & Dresden moniker. Within their 6 years of collaboration, Gabriel & Dresden scored 19 number 1 Billboard Hot Dance/Club Play remixes and tracks, made three DJ-mixed compilation albums, an artist album and won seven International Dance Music Awards. Their tracks 'Arcadia', 'Dangerous Power', 'Let Go', 'Tracking Treasure Down' Andain \"Beautiful Things\" and numerous other masterpieces have turned into some of EDM\u2019s biggest classics. 'As The Rush Comes', by their Motorcycle alias with Jes Brieden, they won the IDMA award for 'Best Progressive Trance Track' as well as peaking at #11 on the official UK top40 charts. The G&D treatment, through remixes and interpretations, was given to tracks by The Killers, Annie Lenox, Sarah McLachlan, Dido, Ti\u00ebsto, Paul Oakenfold and Way Out West, making their sound cross borders from trance and progressive with pop, indie and soul sensibilities.\n\nIn 2008 After 6+ years of hits and and awards, both guys felt it was time for something new and took a break from Gabriel & Dresden to focus on their individual careers. Inspiration came flowing with the new tide. After the split, Josh Gabriel set up his own label, 'Different Pieces' and focused on his Winter Kills and Andain projects. On his album 'Eight', Josh intertwined techno and house into pieces of pure electronic bliss. In the meantime, Dave Dresden took charge of the dancefloor with his Dresden & Johnston project and spawned a US radio hit in the song 'Keep Faith' and \"That Day\" (with Nadia Ali on lead vocals), as well as remixes for the likes of Owl City, Nadia Ali, BT and The Crystal Method. But you simply can't stop musical synergy. \n\nAs 2010 came to an end, Gabriel and Dresden decided to go back to their roots and reunite at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles for New Year\u2019s Eve 2011. Their return behind the decks showed that after two and a half years apart, nothing really changed. Gabriel & Dresden's comeback marks one of the most notable moments in EDM this year, finally answering the call of millions of dance lovers. With gigs at some of the world's biggest festivals, clubs and events planned and a new compilation in the making, Gabriel & Dresden are all set to do what they love most: celebrate music. And we're all invited.",

We\u2019re about making that happen: connecting lesbians and building a network of colleagues, associates and friends in the industry.\r\n\r\nTo Be More Visible To Others\r\n\r\nOutside of Ellen, Rosie, Melissa, and now Tammy, what other mainstream lesbian role models can most people name? We need more examples of lesbian leaders and that means we need to come out as the amazing, successful people we are.\r\n\r\nTo Get More Women and Lesbians in Technology\r\n\r\nLesbians are women first, and right now women are some of the most gifted folks in technology, yet there are far fewer of us than there should be (women account for 1 in 15 people in STEM fields). Because there aren\u2019t enough women, women are rarely quoted as experts by the mainstream media and blogs, on panels, etc. And add the element of being lesbian, it\u2019s equally important for us to represent women, and out women, for our communities.",

        "description": "So one of my goals for awhile has been that I wanted to run a marathon before age 30.  I just turned 28, and I did the half marathon last year.  So, this year is the year that I am going to do it!  I am also going to do the Shamrock Shuffle, possibly the solider field 10 miler, and one of the half marathons.   \n\nI decided to join Imerman Angels and agreed to raise $1000.\n\nI am throwing a Wristband party at Schoolyard Tavern  on April 26th from 8-11.  The wristband is $25, half of that will go to the fundraiser.  I will also be having a raffle for some great prizes. (gift cards, apparel, tickets, etc.)  I am in the process of collecting items for the raffle, so if you have anything you would like to donate or know anyone else that can please message me or text/call me (715-220-5138).  I would greatly appreciate it!!! \n\nIf any of you cannot make it to this fundraiser, but would like to support me running the Chicago Marathon and help raise money for a great cause you can go to the link below and donate.  EVERY dollar counts :)\n\n\nhttp://www.crowdrise.com/stephanieclarke1-TeamIA/fundraiser/stephanieclarke1\n\nA little information on Imerman Angels for those of you that are not familiar: \n\nTeam Imerman Angels is a group of individuals who like to stay fit and have fun.

Crimes Against Humanity is a nihilistic romp through gossipy academic parties, boozy-stake outs, and surreal bedtime stories.\u201d\u2014Jerzy Rose\n\n\u201cRose and co-writer Halle Butler are masters of wry humor, delighting in their characters\u2019 self-pity, casual dishonesty and cruelty. Mike Lopez and Lyra Hill are beyond perfect in the lead roles, generating spark showers of subtextual resentment in their scenes together.\u201d\u2014Paul Sbrizzi, Slamdance Film Festival\n\n\u201cRecalls the fiction of Thomas Pynchon in its mix of conspiracy plots, academic references, and loopy humor\u2026Rose creates a distinct, propulsive rhythm for the comic dialogue.\u201d\u2014Chicago Reader\n\n\u201cStar Lyra Hill\u2019s wide-eyed, increasingly mangled deadpan gaze is worthy of a silent comedy all its own.\u201d\u2014Chicago Tribune",

        "description": "We are happy to have one of Chicago's finest DJs back at The Bower, Diz. Last year he played for the For Those Who Know 12 Year Anniversary party and delivered the dance floor a lengthy set of house education! If you're into house come experience a special night with one Chicago's house aficionados! \n\nFor Those Who Know...\nSATURDAY MARCH 29\nDIZ (Chicago / Iz and Diz)\n\nwith resident\nJUNIOR BROWN\n\n$15 COVER\nDoors at 8pm\nHalf price cocktails from 8pm-10pm\n\nDIz (bio)\nIf life is about \"being in the right place at the right time,\" then Diz's timing could not have been better. Born and raised in Chicago, the original epicenter of the House Music uni-verse, his adolescence coincided with the beginnings of that city's legendary scene. Nowadays, if you mention Diz's name amongst House aficionados, you are almost cer-tain to hear adoration and respect for his insane DJ skills, stage presence, and warm-hearted personality.\n\n\nDiz's musical influences started at home, where his mother's love for Jazz led him to pursue the saxophone for many years. His DJ beginnings were about whatever he could get his hands on, like Disco and old Breaks records inherited from family members. When he was 14, his older brother took him to The Music Box, where Diz witnessed the true potential of House Music: to affect people's emotions and bring them together on a collective journey. He's been striving to do just that ever since, and in the process, has become a faithful participant in the music, the culture, and the times.\n\n\nThroughout high school, he frequented parties featuring DJs such as Frankie Knuckles, Ron Hardy, Farley and many other masters, and finally had a chance to break into the scene at age 19 after meeting contemporaries Mark Farina, Derrick Carter and Spencer Kincey (Gemini). His early gigs were at Alcazar with Gemini, and at one-off parties. At his Wicker Park loft, what started as a means of paying the rent developed into a two-year run as a nightclub, featuring Diz, Farina and Mark Grant on the decks. Soon after-wards, he and his friends took over Shelter, one of the city's \"most severe night spots.\" >From roughly 1993-98, Diz was the Friday resident at Shelter, and the Saturday resi-dent at Red Dog alongside Johnny Fiasco, and since then has held many residencies at other legendary Chicago spots.\n\n\nIn 1995, Diz accepted a job working for his brother's friend, Anthony Pearson (Chez Damier), at PRESCRIPTION (the label founded by Chez and Ron Trent). PRESCRIP-TION conducted distribution business with CAJUAL, and that is how Diz met his future producing partner and close friend, Joshua (whose nickname as fate would have it, was \"Iz\").\n\n\nIn 1995, Iz n Diz produced their first record together, \"Ghosts in Detroit,\" released on PRESCRIPTION's sub-label, BALANCE. A year later, Joshua/Iz moved back to San Francisco, but he and Diz maintained a close friendship over the years and continue to produce together for labels like CLASSIC, AESOTERIC, GUIDANCE, TWEEKIN', SIL-VER NETWORK, and PANHANDLE.",

        "description": "Chicago Farmer returns to Bradley, IL! This time with Local Heros Matt and Jake!\n\nFriday April 18th\n\n10:00 pm\n\n21+ \n\nFREE SHOW!\n\n\nChicago Farmer sings on the title track of Backenforth, IL, out January 22, 2013. It\u2019s the centerpiece of his sixth collection of Guthrie-inspired populist songs, as well as autobiographical. The son of a small town farming community, Cody Diekhoff logged plenty of highway and stage time under the name Chicago Farmer before settling in the city in 2003. Profoundly inspired by fellow mid-westerner John Prine, he\u2019s a working-class folk musician to his core. His small town roots, tilled with city streets mentality, are turning heads North and South of I-80.\n\nBackenforth, IL is also about finding your place in life \u2013 that sweet spot where we all belong. \u201cI love the energy, music, and creativity of Chicago, but at the same time, the roots and hard work of my small town,\u201d he shares. Growing up in Delavan, IL with a population less than 2,000, Diekhoff\u2019s grandparents were farmers, and their values have always provided the baseline of his songs.\n\nHe writes music for the \u201ckind of people that come to my shows. Whether in Chicago or Delavan, everyone has a story, and everyone puts in a long day and works hard the same way,\u201d he says. \u201cMy generation may have been labeled as slackers, but I don\u2019t know anyone who doesn\u2019t work hard \u2013 many people I know put in 50-60 hours a week and 12 hour days. That\u2019s what keeps me playing. I don\u2019t like anyone to be left out; my music is for everyone in big and very small towns.\u201d\n\nHe listened to punk rock and grunge as a kid before discovering a friend\u2019s dad playing Hank Williams, and it was a revelation. Prine and Guthrie quickly followed. The name Chicago Farmer was originally for a band, but the utilitarian life of driving alone from bar to bar, city to city \u2013 to make a direct connection to his audience and listener, took a deeper hold.\n\nSongs like \u201cWorkin\u2019 On It,\u201d are the kind of sing-a-longs he\u2019s known for; it\u2019s become common to see whole rooms full of strangers erupt and sing to the choruses of his songs on first listen. While \u201cThe Twenty Dollar Bill\u201d is more sentimental, reminding everyone of that time their own Grandma surreptitiously passed along a little cash to hang onto.\n\nCody co-produced the album with Chris Harden in Chicago at the I.V. Labs Studios. While the inspiration has never changed, previous albums have been with Nashville session players \u2013 or just himself with guitar and harmonica.\n\nFor Backenforth, IL, he brought in friends for a loose and live vibe, accompanied by \u201cThe Hired Hands,\u201d Darren Garvey on percussion and Mike Davidov on bass. Cody and The Hired Hands were recorded live and on analog tape to capture the feel and authenticity of each performance. Later, some of Chicago\u2019s finest musicians chimed in on pedal steel, resonator, electric and acoustic guitar, organ, dobro, and vocals.\n\nChicago Farmer plans to continue touring relentlessly to support the new album.\n\nWith Backenforth IL, he solidifies that wherever he is, that\u2019s where he belongs, that\u2019s where the songs will be written and sung, and that\u2019s where the music will be played.",

This year we are super hyped to welcome back  Chicago\u2019s finest Disco don Rahaan headlining the bash with fantastic support over both floors. Advance tickets are on sale for a super bargain \u00a34 get them while you can folks we expect a sellout. Rahaan played a few years back at the Spacemachine launch and killed it so we are looking forward to hearing him do the disco again especially on the Bozak mixer.\n\nRahaan is without doubt one of the most traveled and in demand disco disc jockeys on the circuit, and according to the Redbull Academy 'he's not only a Dj, but a Dj's Dj.'Rahaan's been spinning music since the 80s, he got his schooling in disco music when he heard Ron Hardy play at the Music Box in his native Chicago. At the time other Djs like Pierre or Frankie Knuckles were throwing parties too, but it was the unique fashion Ron Hardy served up his disco and house - raw and real - that had left a long lasting impression on Rahaan. Since then, the brother from the Windy city has amassed a more than respectable record collection, mixing up the rare disco and classic always keeping his choice dance floor friendly. Over the years Rahaan has personalised plenty of classic tracks by transforming them into his trademark edits in a similar way Ron Hardy and Theo Parrish have done, with the only exception that he keeps close to the disco sound in his output, occasionally dipping into soul, boogie, jazz funk and funk territory. But above all, the essence of Rahaan's trademark sound is still undeniably 'Chicago' in its energy. There are plenty of soulful and uplifting, but never cheesy vocals. There is consistent groove in his boogie along type sets - all the way to his more bouncing and jackin' basement party style sets, in which you can literally feel the music, sweat and funk in the air. Over the years, plenty of Rahaan mixes that have appeared on sites like Bring The Heat, Deep House Page and the Chuck Brothers, and many fans have been wondering about those special extended and re-arranged and hard to find tracks. \n\nUpstairs hosted by Untitled. After a short break Untitled is back and we'll be helping you to kick start the bank holiday weekend with a very special party. For this event we've teamed up with the good people of the Horse and Groom and will be taking over the top floor of the infamous party pub. After throwing a string of successful parties in 2013 with guests including the likes of Nikos (Krush), Wesley Razzy (Rhythmatic), Bookless & Richard Rowell (Jaunt) we will be sticking to our policy of throwing exciting and intimate parties and have enlisted Stephane Ghenacia (Colors Lnd) to come along and make sure your bank holiday weekend starts off with a bang. Stephane is a new face in the scene who\u2019s hungry to emulate the success of the names he shares the DJ booth with. He's already gaining quite a reputation in the underground with appearances at Fabric's room one alongside Apollonia (Dan Ghenacia, Dyed Soundorom & Shonky). It's clear this guy has an ear for good music",

        "description": "GRZEGORZ TURNAU - polski pianista, kompozytor, aran\u017cer, wokalista i poeta, wyst\u0105pi w dniu 5 kwietnia, 2014 r., o godz. 19-tej, na jednym, d\u0142ugo wyczekiwanym koncercie w Copernicus Center, przy 5216 W. Lawrence Avenue, Chicago. \n\nWszechstronny artysta, kt\u00f3ry stworzy\u0142 sw\u00f3j w\u0142asny, \u0142atwo rozpoznawalny, pe\u0142en czaru i elegancji styl muzyczny i kompozycyjny, czasami nawi\u0105zuj\u0105cy do muzyki jazzowej, smooth-jazzowej, a tak\u017ce do dokona\u0144 Marka Grechuty i Jana Kantego Pawlu\u015bkiewicza, zaprezentuje kompozycje, kt\u00f3re cieszy\u0142y s\u0142uchaczy na przestrzeni niemal 20 lat jego kariery. Laureat wielu nagr\u00f3d, m.in. Mateusza (Nagrody Muzycznej Programu Trzeciego), Wiktora (Nagrody Akademii Telewizyjnej), dw\u00f3ch Superjedynek (plebiscytu w Opolu) oraz dziesi\u0119ciu Fryderyk\u00f3w, do kt\u00f3rych nominowany by\u0142 a\u017c 24 razy, cieszy si\u0119 nies\u0142abn\u0105cym uznaniem. Popularno\u015b\u0107 Turnaua to swoisty fenomen, kt\u00f3ry nie przestaje zadziwia\u0107. Uprawia on bowiem trudny gatunek piosenki z tekstem, czy piosenki poetyckiej spod znaku \u201ckrainy \u0142agodno\u015bci\u201d. Jego utwory to refleksyjne pere\u0142ki, w kt\u00f3rych na happy end raczej nie ma miejsca.  A jednak od wielu lat przyci\u0105ga s\u0142uchaczy, kt\u00f3rym nieobce s\u0105 inne rodzaje muzyki.  Niezwyk\u0142e poczucie humoru artysty, b\u0142yskotliwo\u015b\u0107 i jego dystans do samego siebie, jak i niemal sztubacka figlarno\u015b\u0107, spontaniczne \u017carty i swoiste flirty z publiczno\u015bci\u0105, buduj\u0105 niepowtarzalny nastr\u00f3j wyst\u0119p\u00f3w. Dzi\u0119ki temu recitale Turnaua zawsze pozostawiaj\u0105 publiczno\u015b\u0107 w zadumie, ale i dobrym humorze. Grzegorz Turnau prowadzi z ni\u0105 dialog, spe\u0142niaj\u0105c jej oczekiwania dotycz\u0105ce repertuaru. W zale\u017cno\u015bci od emocji, kt\u00f3re towarzysz\u0105 koncertom, zmienia si\u0119 lista wykorzystywanych utwor\u00f3w. Dlatego ka\u017cde spotkanie z widzami jest inne i niepowtarzalne, a  ka\u017cdy spektakl unikatowy.\n\nKoncert b\u0119dzie wielk\u0105 gratk\u0105 dla fan\u00f3w Grzegorza Turnaua tak\u017ce w warstwie instrumentalnej. Towarzysz\u0105cy wokali\u015bcie Jacek Kr\u00f3lik (gitara), Robert Kubiszyn (gitara basowa, kontrabas), Leszek Szczerba (saksofon, klarnet) i Cezary Konrad (perkusja), to znani i cenieni muzycy jazzowi, \u015bwietni instrumentali\u015bci i autorzy wielu w\u0142asnych przedsi\u0119wzi\u0119\u0107 artystycznych. W kwintecie, prowadz\u0105 z wokalem i fortepianem lidera pe\u0142noprawny d\u017awi\u0119kowy dialog, uwidaczniaj\u0105cy ich w\u0142asne muzyczne osobowo\u015bci.\n\nElitarny Grzegorz Turnau, w doborowym towarzystwie swojego zespolu, a wraz z nimi \u201cWszystko, co piekne...\u201d ju\u017c 5 kwietnia!\n\nBILETY:\n\n773-415-4910, POLAMER, KSIEGARNIE: D&Z, WRONA\n\nwww.bilety.com, www.kulturka.us, www.uptosound.com, www.copernicuscenter.org",

What follows is an album as pretty as it is noisy and jarring, displacing the lessons learned during adolescence with instinct and naivety. Television Fuzz studies the existential crises that comes on the onset of every graduation; from high school, from college, from one job to the next, but most importantly, graduating from adolescence to adulthood.\n\nDRAFT WEEK\n\nChicago is home to some of alternative rock's most acclaimed artists including the Smashing Pumpkins and Wilco.
