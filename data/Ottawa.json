Painters create the best work they can in 20 minutes. As they work, patrons move around the easels, closely watching the creative process. The medium is acrylic paint and the tools allowed are brushes, palette knives or any non-mechanical implements. At the end of the round, the audience votes democratically for their favourite painting and bids in silent auction to take the work home. This is Art Battle Canada\u2019s 5th season and first full season in Ottawa.\n\nArt Battle 120\nMonday, May 5th, 7pm\nArts Court, 2 Daly Ave\nTickets 15$ door/10$ Limited Advance online\n$10 at the door for Students and Seniors",

        "description": "On November 4, 2008 Proposition 8 passed in California, amending the state Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. The defeat provoked a groundswell of initiative within the GLBT community at a grassroots level, with many new political and protest organizations being formed in response. \n\nThe NOH8 Campaign is a photographic silent protest created by celebrity photographer Adam Bouska (http://www.bouska.net) and partner Jeff Parshley in direct response to the passage of Proposition 8. Photos feature subjects with duct tape over their mouths, symbolizing their voices being silenced by Prop 8 and similar legislation around the world, with \"NOH8\" painted on one cheek in protest.\n\n\nFive years since its inception, the NOH8 Campaign has grown to nearly 33,000 faces and continues to grow at an exponential rate. The campaign began with portraits of everyday Californians from all walks of life and soon rose to include politicians, military personnel, newlyweds, law enforcement, artists, celebrities, and many more. \n\nThe NOH8 Campaign has received overwhelming support from around the world, and has appeared in various local and national news programs and publications. The images are widely used on various social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter to spread the message of equality.\n\nTO PARTCIPATE, \"like\" and \"share\" this event. Once we have enough people we will confirm with Adam Bouska and tell him how proud we are in the Nations Capital to help on this awesome campaign.\n\nThank you all for your support",

Since the beginning of the 2000s, the region is in a transition from neoliberalism towards neo-developmentism involving resource extraction, the development of new knowledge and state-led initiatives.\nThis year\u2019s conference aims to examine the contradictions, opportunities and consequences that have emerged in the past few years to promote discussion on topics such as:\n- development and resource extraction,\n- indigenous and gender issues, \n- human rights, \n- social movements, \n- citizenship, democracy and governance,\n- public policy and programs,\n- regional integration projects (e.g. ALBA, CELAC, MERCOSUR),\n- Canada's role in the region,\n- culture, religion, and identities.\nThis conference is organized by a multi-disciplinary committee of graduate students from the University of Ottawa, Carleton University, and the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Outaouais (UQO).\nThe inscription fees are 10 $CAD for students.\n\nVERSION EN FRAN\u00c7AIS:\n\nDepuis les vingt derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les transformations au niveau de l\u2019\u00e9conomie politique des pays d\u2019Am\u00e9rique latine ont conduit \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9gration de certains secteurs de la population et des territoires, mais \u00e9galement \u00e0 la marginalisation d\u2019autres secteurs.

        "description": "Two of Canada\u2019s most treasured and celebrated trans artists, Ivan Coyote and Rae Spoon, present their acclaimed multimedia show \u201cGender Failure,\u201d featuring animation and video elements from Seattle artist Clyde Petersen. Through visuals, words, sounds, and original music, \u201cGender Failure\u201d explores and exposes the prolific pair\u2019s failed attempts at fitting into the gender binary\u2014and ultimately how the gender binary doesn\u2019t add up. Coyote brings their razor-sharp timing and powerful narrative, while Spoon adds an ethereal voice and poetic turns of phrase to the dynamic duo\u2019s now seven-year-old artistic partnership.\n\nThis is also the official Ottawa launch of their book \"Gender Failure,\" a poignant collection of autobiographical essays, lyrics, and images documenting Ivan and Rae's personal journeys from gender failure to gender self-acceptance. Equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking, it's a book that will touch LGBTQ readers and others, revealing, with candor and insight, that gender comes in more than two sizes. Gender Failure is co-written by Rae and Ivan and published by Arsenal Pulp Press:\n\nhttp://www.arsenalpulp.com/bookinfo.php?index=398\n\nPlease join us in welcoming these amazing artists on April 25th at Knox Presbyterian Church, 120 Lisgar Street (at Elgin). This space is wheelchair accessible and has a wheelchair accessible washroom onsite.\n\nTickets\nIn Advance: General 20$/Reduced 15$/ Members FREE\nAt the Door: General 25$/Reduced 20$/Members FREE\n\nFor more information about the performers check out:\n\nwww.ivanecoyote.com\nwww.raespoon.com",

If passed, this act will see US style voter suppression imposed on Canadians and is clearly targeted youth and students, poor people, seniors, Aboriginal people and other marginalized groups. \n\nThe \u201cFair Elections Act\u201d eliminates key provisions of our current election system \u2013 including vouching and voter information cards \u2013 which could deprive as many as 520,000 Canadians of their right to vote. The Act will also muzzle Elections Canada, cancelling voter education and engagement programs like Student Vote.\n\nA day of action is planned for Thursday, April 24th, 2014. In Ottawa, a rally is being at the Fairmont Ch\u00e2teau Laurier at 11am. \n\nPierre Poilievre will be \"Discussing the Facts\" of the Fair Elections at an Economic Club of Canada lunch.

More Please! songs evoke the tension of a polarized Canadian experience, transporting you from gritty city life, through rolling countryside to the woods, and back again.\n\nMore Please! has evolved into a shared adventure amongst friends. Chris Norman, Nathan Doucet (Crosss, Mike O\u2019Neil) and Ian MacKay (Basia Bulat) first joined Scotty to create the band. \n\nAfter producer and touring artist David Celia recorded a demo of the band in his 1970\u2019s Mississauga bungalow, he joined More Please! and produced a full-length record at his home studio Organica and at Andy Magoffin's House of Miracles. The culmination of this effort is the debut More Please! album The Bounty, to be released in the spring of 2014. The diversity of the rhythms, the inspired arrangements, the balance between psychedelic folk, progressive rock and indie pop will take you on a sonic journey. \n\nMore Please! has found inspiration by collaborating live and in the studio with a wide range of musicians: Warren Spicer and Mathew Woodley (Plants and Animals), Joe Grass (Patrick Watson), Josh Toal (Katie Moore), Dani Oore (Gypsophelia), Bob Wiseman (Blue Rodeo), Leanne Zacharias (Christine Fellows, Hylozoists), Sarah Page (Barr Brothers), Bryden Baird (Fiest), Rebekah Higgs, Jeff Louch and Terra Lightfoot among others.\n\nThe More Please! adventure does not end with the album; witnessing a live performance will let you experience their musical landscape first-hand \n\nDELTA WILL\n\n***www.deltawill.com\n***www.facebook.com/deltawillmusic\n\nDelta Will is an interstellar visitor - an alien that has fallen in love with humanity and its traditions of folk, blues and pop music. Using Charles Tilden\u2019s body as its vessel, Delta Will has been translating its earthly experiences into its own artful pop songs. Combining infectious layers of soaring vocals, spacey guitar riffs and pulsating beats, Delta Will\u2019s music has been described as a crafty, charming spell that rouses between modern blues and romantic art rock.\n\nThe songs contemplate what it means to be human and what to make of an uncertain and potentially apocalyptic future. Each Delta Will performance is an intimate and unpredictable experience, with live mash-ups of influential songs thrown in to the set of original material.",

HARPER: ENTRE LE CHIEN ET LE LOUP\nFeb. 7 to June 6, 2014\nGuest Curator: Ann MacDonald, Doris McCarthy Gallery\nA multi-layered expression, \u201centre chien et loup\u201d is used to describe a specific time of day, just before night, when the light is so dim one cannot distinguish a dog from a wolf. David R. Harper\u2019s remarkably varied practice exemplifies carefully considered ventures into the history of humankind, and histories of making objects for contemplation.\nOrganized by the Doris McCarthy Gallery in partnership with the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery, Kenderdine Art Gallery, and Saint Mary\u2019s University Art Gallery.\n\nR\u00c9MI TH\u00c9RIAULT: FRONT\nFeb. 7 to June 6, 2014\nCurator: Ola Wlusek\nFront reflects on the role nature plays in helping individuals heal and remember. The exhibition consists of a series of large-scale colour photographs by the Ottawa-based artist, focusing on the physical transformation of European sites where Canadian armies fought in the First World War. Literary works by Andrew Vincent and Colin Vincent accompany the exhibition.\n\nBRINGING IT HOME: ABSTRACTION AND THE PAINTERS ELEVEN\nJan. 11 to March 23, 2014\nGuest Curator: David Kaarsemaker\nThe Painters Eleven, based in Toronto, were united in a desire to bring to Canada the exciting artistic developments occurring on the international stage.

La d\u00e9marche remarquablement vari\u00e9e de David R.

Musicians of intermediate level and up are encouraged to participate in the jam.  If you will be calling a tune, you must bring at least three copies of lead sheets in your concert C key for other musicians, and charts for Bb and Eb instruments would be appreciated by horn players.\n\nThe Carleton Tavern\n223 Armstrong Street (at Parkdale, one block north of Wellington St. West, and immediately north of the Parkdale Market)\nOttawa",

The book's central character undergoes a series of startling transformations, shape-shifting through figures drawn from film, television, music, books, porn flicks, and comics. Often accompanied by family members, this narrator becomes Godzilla, Suzi Quatro, Whitney Houston's bodyguard, a Muppet, a gay leatherman, a nun who becomes a governess to the von Trapp children, and, in the book's lavish climax, a 100-foot-tall guitar-wielding rock star performing for an adoring troupe of fans in Tokyo.\n\nInfluenced by the teen book series Sweet Valley High, Tom Cho began writing creative works in his mid-teens. He has a PhD in Professional Writing from Deakin University and, alongside his work as a fiction writer, he has a parallel career as a freelance writer and editor. Like his favorite pop stars, Tom enjoys trying new guises on for size, and his work has been described as being \"transgenre, transgender, and transcultural all at once.\" Born and raised in Australia, Tom is a newcomer to North America.\n \nBOUNDARY PROBLEMS by Greg Bechtel\n \n\u201cBoundary Problems is a chaotic collection with comic touches, a paranoid Pynchonesque mix-tape of hosers and hipster cafes, office jobs and summer camp confessions, lit theory and online porn. Boundary problems? No problem for Greg Bechtel; his debut is wild, sly, and magnetic.\u201d \u2013 Mark Anthony Jarman, author of 19 Knives\n \nOriginally from Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario, Greg Bechtel has lived at various times in Toronto, Deep River, Jamaica, Ottawa, Quebec City, and Fredericton while working (among other things) as a lifeguard, technical writer, mover, visual basic programmer, camp counsellor, semiconductor laser labtech, cab driver, tutor, and teacher. Currently, he lives and writes in Edmonton, where he teaches English Literature and Creative Writing at the University of Alberta whenever they let him. Boundary Problems is his first book.",

There will also be some music and a few short statements.\n\nIf you can, please bring a visual symbol of the bright future you want to see \u2013 a drop of water, a tree, a polar bear \u2013 please see this guide for creating amazing visuals: https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.defendourclimate.ca/May+12/DoC-Visuals+Kit.pdf\n\nThe Rideau Falls lies 40km downstream from where the Energy East pipeline would cross the Rideau River. This area could be potentially devastated by a pipeline spill.\n\nWith the recently proposed Energy East pipeline joining other proposed pipelines across the country, our local watersheds and land are under direct threat. If these pipelines were built, they would make it impossible for Canada to do its fair share to stop climate change.\n\nWe have a real opportunity to change that. As millions of people in the United States stand together against the Keystone XL pipeline, it\u2019s our job here to stand for a  better energy future.\n\nGlobally, there is now more investment in renewable energy than all fossil fuels combined. Canada could be making a needed transition to renewable energy that would help ensure a safe climate for future generations.\n\nWe  need to make a stand for this to happen. We cannot allow for reckless tar sands expansion, or the construction of pipelines like Energy East that would facilitate that expansion.\n\nJoin us \u2013 and 60 other communities \u2013 who are uniting their voices on May 10th, to say no to tar sands expansion, no to the proposed energy east pipeline, and yes to a safe climate future and renewable energy.",

Transporting 1.1 million barrels of oil every day, it would be the largest oil pipeline in North America.\n\nThis tour is taking place at the same time as Ontario Energy Board consultations on the pipeline. These consultations are an important platform to have our voices heard, and encourage our provincial government to stand up for Ontarians against this broken pipeline plan.\n\nFor background information and to read more, please visit http://canadians.org/energyeast-tour",

I'm not out of the woods yet, but everyday will be a positive, up hill battle.  \n\nI was in the hospital for 11 days and received the best care I could have wished for at the Ottawa Civic Hospital. The staff was professional, kind and possessed expertise like no other! \n\nDuring my time there,  I was in the Acute Neurological Intensive Care unit and was lucky enough to be given one of the \"Cadillac\" beds. Those beds are very limited in the ward and not every patient gets to have one...but they do help provide the appropriate care needed for people in need recovering from cancers, strokes, and more.\n\nI want to pay the Ottawa Civic Hospital back for the terrific care I've received.\n\nWhen they gave my bed to someone that was more in need (and assigned me to a normal bed), I realized that every patient that was placed into that ward shouldn't be sleeping on the normal beds that are extremely uncomfortable but one of those \"Cadillac\" beds.\n\nI hope that the proceeds raised can go towards the purchase of another \"Cadillac\" bed for the ward.\"\n\n\nEvent will be comprised of:\n\nSilent auction\nStarts:: March 30 9 A.M \nCloses: April 6th noon\n\nHandle with Care wrestling exhibition brought to you by the stars Mecca Pro Wrestling.\n\n\nLive Entertainment  featuring some of Eastern Ontario's top talent such as RMJ and The FreakBoy, Right on Band from Ottawa.\n\nFace painting and family fun games \n\n50/50 draw.\n\nThe event will have a BBQ and baked goods will also be sold.\n\n100% of the profits goes to the Ottawa Hospital Neurology Department!\n\nThanks everyone!

        "description": "I'm sure all of you are aware by this point that I play and coach quidditch. My team, GeeGees Quidditch, won Canadian Cup this year and will be going to the World Cup in South Carolina to represent our school and Canada - we are one of only 4 Canadian teams going. One of those other 4 teams is our sister team, Maple Rush Quidditch. They also represent uOttawa, and we're all super excited for the chance to have 2 of the top 4 Canadian teams representing our school.\n\nIn order to get to World Cup though, we're doing a lot of fundraising. We have 42 international-level athletes plus 2 coaches all trying to get there, and as students we don't have a whole lot of our own money! We're all going to be paying for our own flights and are hoping to fundraise enough to cover hotels and transportation on the ground in Myrtle Beach. \n\nThis group of people is my family here in Ottawa. We have Thanksgiving and Easter dinners, study parties during exams, and help each other out with life when we need it. I would personally really appreciate it if you can donate anything - even $1 or $2 would help! Every athlete we're taking puts in hours of work every week and we're hoping that this year we can be the first non-US team to make the Sweet 16 (last year we were the first non-US team to make bracket play, so this year we want to make it further!). \n\nWe have some pretty fantastic thank-you gifts if you donate. There's everything from a twitter shout-out to a postcard from Myrtle Beach to a custom tote-bag, hand-made by yours truly! Every little bit helps. Even if you can't donate, I'd really appreciate if you could pass this link on to your friends and anyone you know of who might support a group of Canadian quidditch players! \n\nIndiegogo link can be found here: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/uottawa-quidditch-goes-to-world-cup\n\nThank you in advance for any donations or passing-on of the link! If you donate, let me know, because I want to be able to send you a thank-you note :)",

The same year the band released the album \u201cStigmata High-Five\u201d and toured extensively, only to take a break from the road to record their sophomore release \u201cDisgorge Mexico\u201d in 2008.\n\nFollowing the release of \u201cDisgorge Mexico\u201d, Fuck The Facts took a step back to the band\u2019s more DIY roots with a number of independent releases.  A 3rd full length for Relapse Records, \u201cDie Miserable\u201d, was released in 2011 and nominated for a Juno in the Best Metal/Hard Rock Album category.  \n\nNow with the acclaimed newest release \u201cAmer\u201d, which was produced entirely at the band\u2019s own studio (Apartment 2) and self-released, Fuck The Facts continues to grow not only musically, but also with DIY independence, showing that there really is no end in sight. \n\n\nRITUAL DICTATES ( Vancouver, BC )\nhttps://facebook.com/ritualdictates\n\nInspired by a wide array of styles and instruments, the music itself has straightforward elements of metal and grind, with detours into anything from half time black metal to good time rock and roll.\n\nPicking up on inspiration from their respective previous bands Allfather and Angel Grinder, Justin and Ash are continuing down the heavy metal path while fusing their eclectic influences of classic rock and roll, punk, black metal and grind into interesting new places.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nFor Party/Guestlist service inquiries please contact:\nguestlist@electricowl.ca\n\nLike our Page! => https://www.facebook.com/ElectricOwlSocialClub\n\nInterested in joining our Street Team?

        "description": "In late April 2012, the federal government announced a series of sweeping changes to the Interim Federal Health (IFH) program (http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/outside/arriving-healthcare.asp), the health insurance program for refugees in Canada. The changes came into effect on June 30, 2012. On June 29th the federal government announced after significant public pressure that government assisted refugees would not be impacted by these cuts.\n\nThe previous IFH program provided access to medical care, diagnostic services and laboratory testing very similar to what is provided by provincial health plans. It also provided access to medications, emergency dental care and vision care similar to what is available to people on provincial social assistance plans.\n\nHealth care workers across the country have organized to oppose these cuts and advocate for their reversal. Many feel that resettled refugees are suffering or will suffer tremendous hardship by not being able to access medications. They are at risk of severe complications. Health care workers are also deeply concerned that people from DCO\u2019s are unable to access care for even life threatening conditions. Many have also suggested that the cuts will only result in increased costs.\n\nOrganizations opposing cuts to refugee health care:\ni. College of Family Physicians of Canada\nii.

Scientist Eugene Melnick attempted to create a product that would enhance your appearance & make you the perfect somebody. Something went wrong, & the product - instead of creating perfection, caused horrific deformities & an uncontrollable desire for human flesh. You are now one of the few remaining survivors, will you run, or will you hide? Will you remain loyal to your group? You have one immunity injection left, will you end your team-mates life and extend \nthe duration of your own? Or will sacrifice your own life to let your team-mates live? The choice is yours, so choose wisely.\n\nfind us:\nON SATURDAY, JUNE 28TH WE WILL BE MEETING OUTSIDE THE TIM HORTONS ON HUNTCLUB! from there, we will be walking to the woods.

At the end of the round, the zombie with the most flags will be awarded a prize.\n\nSurvivors: Your goal is to hide out from the Zombie's for two and a half hours. You will be given (A) flag upon your entry into the game this is your ''immunity''. If this is removed from your waist, you have lost and must make your way back to base. AKA out of the forest - once there tell one of the organizers (in the plain white shirts that you've been caught.)  There is no Dress Code.

        "description": "EVENT DETAILS:\n**********************\n\nRe: 96 hour protest May 1 until May 4th 2014.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOur protest is called World Wide March Waking Up The Masses. It was originally the World Wide March Against Corruption combined with the Omnibus March Against Harper in Canada.  The goal of waking up the masses through protest is education of the corruption going on in Canada and around the world. Although this is happening in many locations in Canada we would like as many Canadians that can make the trip to Ottawa for this protest as possible to come.\n\nThroughout the event there will be all ministers, military officials, diplomats, and special guests arriving in Ottawa. We have a permit for a peaceful protest and welcome all groups, families and individuals to join us. \n\nDuring the day from 7am until 9pm we will be protesting on Parliament Hill with marches every 2 hours one group from Parliament hill to the human rights monument on Lisgar and Elgin. Also a second group Marching from Parliament Hill to 58 George street in the Byward Market. Of course back to Parliament Hill again. \n\nAt 9pm each night we will be on the Wellington street side of the gate. On the sidewalks until 7am each morning. Then we will move back to the Parliament Hill Side. During the evening on the Wellington street side we will be protesting and sleeping/sitting in chairs or standing. We will leave enough room for pedestrians to be able to also use the sidewalk. I have spoken with the Ottawa police as we have discussed and informed them of all this.  We have been peaceful, polite and cleaned up our mess. This time will be no different.\n\nOn May 4, 2014 ; we are aware there is another event taking place on Parliament Hill. For this day we have reserved the North West side of Wellington street and Metcalfe for our protest. That would be from approx 7am until 3pm. It is right where all the ministers, military, diplomats and guest speakers will be hosting their event. The will see and hear everything we are doing.\n\nOur group is more than happy to work with all people, groups and organizations who want to stop government corruption to make this a constructive, peaceful protest. Please contact the Admins if you have any questions.\nAlso, please join the Canada event page : \nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1473029886258968/\nYou can find the list of locations in Canada on the top post of the Canada page. \nPlease note the description for the march is different on the Canada page, which is mainly focused on  taking down Harper and stopping the pipeline....for the world. \nWe are all in this together. \n\n***************************************************************\n\nOnce again let us unite all groups for this event. Every one is welcome. Everyone is welcome. All groups and organizations.\n\nTHIS TIME IT IS A 4 DAY EVENT TO REALLY WAKE UP THE MASSES. NOT EVERYONE CAN BE THERE ALL FOUR DAYS BUT PLEASE COME OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DURING THE 4 DAY EVENT!\n\n\nPeace and respect to everyone.\n\n****************************************************************\n\nPlease meet at Parliament Hill near the flame at noon. Please dress the weather. Please bring water to drink and signs to display. We will protest on the hill. We will be contacting media to let them know we will be there protesting against our government for their corruption. Bring Cameras if you wish and this will be peaceful but it is a good thing to have a buddy system. I also ask that people bring a garbage bag or two. We would like to keep the area clean. This is our planet we don't want to mess it up ;)\n\n****************************************************************\nTHANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO MARCHED ON MARCH 1, 2014 FOR THE WORLD WIDE MARCH AGAINST GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION. WE ARE SO PROUD OF ALL OF YOU! \nPlease see the Canada Slideshow on the Canada page as well as the World Wide slideshow and video accessible on the World Wide main event page.",

I have had three incredibly wonderful natural home birth experiences in 2006, 2009, and 2011. I have supported many women through pregnancy and birth. I have seen how information, support, and belief in yourself, your baby, and birth can transform women, families, and lives forever.\"\n\n\u201cFor me an empowered birth is one where I am the one who makes the decisions for me and my baby. Where I am in an environment of love, support, and respect for the power within my body to successfully birth my baby. Where I can be free to express anything I need to express; sound, movement, fear, love, ecstasy in a place that my expression will not lead to interference from the outside. I believe women have the ability to create an empowering birth experience regardless of if the birth outcome is natural, medicated, or surgical. When women are making the decisions for their bodies and their babies out of education, faith, belief and confidence in themselves and not out of fear or manipulation they will be empowered. I believe in the human body, in it\u2019s power, and in birth\u2019s ability to transform a person, woman, wife, and mother.\u201d \n\nFor more info see: \nhttp://yourbirthcoach.com\nhttp://naturalbirthbabyandbeyond.com\nhttp://facebook.com/yourbirthcoachdrnancy\n\n\nor contact Nancy via:\ninfo@yourbirthcoach.com\n613-823-1255\n\nTopics previously discussed:\n'Positive Birth Is...'\n'Prenatal Testing'\n'Oxytocin'\n'Improving Birth'\n 'Risk'\n 'Fear'\n 'The Hour After Birth'\n 'Choices in Birth'\n 'Birth Place'\n 'Language of Birth'\n'Images of Birth'",

This was a feast for the followers; faithful renditions for the many die hard starship troopers that were no doubt reliving many scrapbook Yes memories over the years. But the show was not about mere nostalgia. This is a band that still feels strangely new, simply by doing what they do, pushing the boundaries and presenting songs that, like the wildly colorful and original Roger Dean artwork that represents them, are just beautifully designed and built to last.\u201d\n\nSPECIAL PACKAGES\nYES is proud to provide special show packages, which include near-stage seating, a Meet and Greet with the band, exclusive limited-edition gifts from YES, and much more.\n\nYes - Meet & Greet Package\nPackage includes:\nOne reserved ticket located in the first 5 rows of the stage\nExclusive autograph session with Yes\nPersonal photograph with Yes\nSpecially designed tour shirt (limited to VIP packages only)\nCollectible tour poster (numbered, limited)\nRemastered, super audio CD copy of \"Close to the Edge\"\nSet of official Yes guitar picks (with case)\nOfficial meet & greet laminate\nOn-site VIP host\nLimited availability\n\nYes - VIP Tour Package\nPackage includes:\nOne reserved ticket located in the first 15 rows of the stage\nSpecially designed tour shirt (limited to VIP packages only)\nCollectible tour poster (numbered, limited)\nRemastered, super audio CD copy of \"Close to the Edge\"\nSet of official Yes guitar picks (with case)\nCommemorative VIP laminate\nLimited availability\n\nTIMES\nAll Shows are Three Album Shows with Doors at 6:30pm, Show at 7:30pm.

This show is brought to you by Jackson Reed & Jessica Bolduc (Ears and Eyes - Sault Music and Art Community) and Andrea Pinheiro (180 Projects). We hope you can come. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Twin Voices:\n\nTwin Voices is an indie electro-folk project with roots in the Ottawa Valley and wings in Saskatoon and Montreal. Laura Beach crafts a dark and lovely sound with live looping of violin, voice, percussion and guitar. Her performance is equal parts stunning simplicity and playful complexity.\n\nListen: https://twinvoices.bandcamp.com/\n\nAbout Gunner and Smith:\n\nIt\u2019s been an eventful past four years for Saskatoon\u2019s Gunner & Smith. Starting in 2010 as a solo project by folk artist Geoff Smith, the band evolved into a multi-member indie country rock ensemble that traverses the rocky line between post-prairies balladeering and grit-covered rockers for those given to heavy highway drives and long, expansive thoughts. Gunner & Smith recently released their first full-length album, He Once Was a Good Man, on Feb. 25th, 2014.\n\nListen: http://gunnerandsmith.bandcamp.com/\n\nAbout Heritage: \n\nHeritage is the low-fi field recording/experimental folk project by Sault Ste. Marie native Jackson Reed. With influences steeped in alternative-country and independent Canadiana music, Jackson brings an honest, stripped down and naked approach to the traditional singer songwriter profile.\n\nListen: http://heritageheritage.bandcamp.com\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHE HAIRY DETAILS: \n\n$5 students, $10 general\nDoors 7:30, show at 8:00\nAll Ages\n180 Projects - 180 Gore Street\nThursday May 29th, 2014",

Essentially a small group of us have been getting together since November to meet up a few times a month and just praise God, wherever we could meet up. We wanted to find an authentic heart of worship. To lay aside egos, big set ups, distractions- anything not of God- and find the joy of praise in simplicity. As interest grew, we needed bigger spaces (Thanks St. Philip's!).\n\nAll you need is to bring yourself and a willing heart. If you play an instrument, bring it out!!!!!

        "description": "We are happy to announce that our May artist will be Rebekah Elkerton! \n\nRebekah Elkerton is a 24 year old artist from Chippewas of the Thames First Nation. Rebekah graduated from Carleton University with a Bachelor of Arts in Women\u2019s and Gender Studies and will begin her Graduate studies in the Fall of 2014. She grew up in the Toronto area and at a very young age used her passion for drawing and painting as an outlet to express herself. \n\nIn her teen years Rebekah attended a regional arts secondary school program before moving to Ottawa in 2007 to begin her post-secondary studies. Throughout her studies and personal experiences, Rebekah discovered her passion of improving the lives of Indigenous women. Through a creative interplay of striking colors, Rebekah paints portraits of women with the aim of decolonizing stereotypical images of women. \n\nSome of her portraits are self-portraits while others are representations of close friends who have shared their stories of pain and struggle with her. Each painting is completed with the use of Acrylic paint on salvaged wood, as a means of reviving an otherwise discarded material.\n\nVernissage will include snacks, spoken word and music!\n\nPerformers: \n\nVera Wabegijig \nPoet, Writer and Media Artist. \nw: http://verawaabegeeshig.wordpress.com/\n\nGiselle Gotti-Chanel\nDrag Performer\nf: https://www.facebook.com/giselle.gotti?fref=ts\n\n***Tune in, Aboriginal CKCU Radio 93.1fm Program (http://aboriginalckcu.com/) on April 27th from 9am - 10am.

        "description": "Which of us has not been caught short by our need for a toilet? The Crohns and Colitis Foundation surveyed their members in 2008 only to find that more than 75% of them had been humiliated in this way. What parent has not had their child urinate or defecate behind a tree in a park? Which pregnant woman, tourist, bus user, cyclist or jogger has not had moments where they worry about getting to a facility in time?\n\nAlthough Ottawa does have public restrooms in large parks, their hours do not accommodate need. Small parks, rinks and splash pads often have no washroom facilities at all. transit stations do not have public toilets. In the downtown, where bars and restaurants are located, residents complain about people urinating after hours in laneways and buildings, and restaurant and bar owners fret about non-paying customers using their washrooms. Accessible toilets are a public health issue. The current situation is unacceptable in a capital city!\n\nPlease join Joan Kuyek, Chair of the \u201cGottaGo!\u201d campaign for a discussion of this initiative aimed to create a network of safe, accessible, free, clean and environmentally responsible public toilets and water fountains in key public places in Ottawa, learn what actions other municipalities are taking to match the effective public toilet programs of Tokyo, Paris, London, Seoul, Portland (Oregon) and other progressive cities. \n\nNoon \nWednesday April 16 2014 \nOctopus Books Centretown Location \n@ 25One Community (2nd Floor, 251 Bank St.)\n\nFree\n\nBring Your Lunch!\n\n\u201cPublic toilets represent society\u2019s finest aspirations about responsible civil behaviour. A great city has great public toilets\u201d  (Bridgeman). \n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\nJoan Kuyek is the chair of GottaGo!  and has been an activist organizer since the 1960s, based in Kingston  and then in Sudbury. In 1999, she moved to Ottawa as the founding National Co-ordinator of MiningWatch Canada. Retired  in 2009,  she continues to work as a contract instructor at Carleton, Queen\u2019s and Algoma Universities, and with communities facing mining issues.

It is a portrait of two projects \u2013 Tamera, a peace research centre in Portugal which organized the pilgrimage, and the Colombian peace community San Jos\u00e9 de Apartad\u00f3.\n\nThe film shows the coming together of the two communities, their encounters with other peace activists and groups in the city of Bogota, shanty towns and remote areas, and with government officials to create a network of protection for the peace community in Colombia and to show a possible path toward a global culture of peace in a seemingly hopeless situation.\n\n\"For the blindness of those who are murderers makes them unable to see that they can do what they want, there will always be community as long as pain turns into hope.\"\n\u2014Eduar Lanchero, peace community San Jos\u00e9 de Apartad\u00f3",

It is a book that is both practical and profound -- aimed at resolving political and military conflicts, and yet which can apply equally well to conflicts in personal relations.\n\nDr. Hicks, from Harvard's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, has over two decades of experience using dignity to resolve conflict, between people and nations, in the U.S., Columbia, Middle East, Sri Lanka, Cuba, and Northern Ireland. Among her many achievements was co-hosting with Archbishop Desmond Tutu the BBC show Facing the Truth, which brought victims and perpetrators of the Northern Ireland conflict together to find resolution.\n\nIn addition to sponsorship by the Harvard Alumni Association and the Harvard Club of Ottawa, her talk is a Edith Holtom Lecture, a series on the pursuit of peace sponsored by the First Unitarian Congregation of Ottawa. Among previous lecturers in this series have been Ed Broadbent and Flora MacDonald.  The sanctuary is itself a peaceful and dignified place in which to hold this lecture.  \n\nAttendees are invited for refreshments after the talk.\nFor those who would like to read her book in advance, it is available online.  Some of the introduction can be downloaded free at http://goo.gl/8XHial\n\nNet proceeds and donations from this event will be donated to the Collaborative Justice Program: Restorative Justice Ottawa (www.collaborativejustice.ca). This program was initiated by the Church Council on Justice and Corrections (CCJC), a national, ecumenical, bilingual charitable organization mandated to assist churches and communities to reflect on and more deeply engage issues in the field of criminal justice.\n\nThe link to purchase advance tickets ($20) is at  http://donnahicksmay8.eventbrite.ca or donate at the door.",

        "description": "May is Bike to Work month - \nMay is also bus-pass-is-up month -\nSolution: Ride your bike to school!!\n\nAs part of the VP Community Health representative for the upcoming year, I want to invite you all to Ride your Bike to school for May! This campaign is all about promoting cycling in our community! We want to advocate for cycling as a form of healthy active living, but also for injury prevention through cycling safety and awareness. Please join us!\n\nIf you don't have a bike - walk, run, skip - whatever suits your fancy. \n\nFun Facts about Cycling in Ottawa\n\t- There are over 600km of bike paths in the national capital region \n\t- OC-transpo busses have a \"Rack and Roll\" program - lets you take your bike with you from mid-April until October 31 each year. If you\u2019re running late or catch a flat, you can hop on any of more than 350 buses equipped with front-mounted bikeracks.  You may also be allowed on the bus with your bike IF there is room. \n\t- Cyclists are permitted to board the O-Train year-round.\n\t- There are several bike co-ops or reuse centres where you can find used bikes or bike parts such as:\n\t\t\u25cb UOttawa Bike Coop - http://sfuo.ca/bikes/\n\t\t\u25cb Re-Cycles Community Bicycle Shop - www.re-cycles.ca\n\t\t\u25cb Recyclore - www.recyclore.org\n\t- \"Ride the City Ottawa\" has a website that will let you map out your route based on preference of \"most direct\", \"safe\" or \"Safer\" - www.ridethecity.com/ottawa\n\t\nEvents this month (and some more in the works\u2026)\n\t- Sunday May 4th  - Group ride from RGN to main campus to familiarize with the bike route and road rules. \n\t- Sunday May 11th - Group ride/ carpool to MEC BikeFest in Westboro\n\t- Potential Bike Maintenance 101 workshop - 1-2 hr session, pending interest from students.\n\nTips for riding in traffic\n\t- Wear a helmet - your brain is worth a lot, protect it. Pretty simple. \n\t- You ARE a vehicle, thus you have the same RIGHTS and RESPONSIBILITIES\n\t- You ARE NOT a pedestrian, thus - don't ride on the sidewalks. You may, of course, WALK your bike on the sidewalk.\n\t- Be assertive but predictable. Stay out of cars' and ESPECIALLY trucks' blind-spots.\n\t- Take the space you need to feel safe, just because you are on a bike does not mean you have to ride through the crappy potholes and eroding shoulder.\n\t- Give yourself 1m space between you and parked cars/sidewalk.\n\t- Have a white front light and red rear light for riding at night. In fact, it's the law. \n\nIf planning on biking, I strongly encourage everyone to review the following resources:\nFor signs and road markings:\nhttp://ottawa.ca/en/residents/transportation-and-parking/cycling/signs-and-markings\nFor City of Ottawa Road Laws for Cyclists:\u000bhttp://ottawa.ca/en/residents/transportation-and-parking/cycling/cycling-and-law",

A night to strut your stuff. \n\nThere IS a dress code. Suits... ties and jackets. Dresses. I don't care what gender you are underneath your clothing but please DO dress up for it. Feel fancy. Get your gorgeous on. Will I turn you away if you show up in jeans and tshirt? Newp... I shan't... but I will adore you all the more if you dress for the occasion.\n\nThis is an evening event so no 'family afternoon hour' unfortunately, which means if you gots kids you'll need to arrange a babysitter. \n\nBring your own alcohol. Munchies will occur. Music will be provided. Interesting and intriguing people will be in attendance.\n\nNote: there will be a smoking room in the back for those what smoke tobacco. Please, only tobacco. There are no pets for those with allergies.\n\nFor those what have not been here before, it's Apartment 4. No buzz code, just press the button marked '4' at the front door. There is street parking and the location is about two long blocks from Billings Bridge, serviced by several busses. It is one flight up from the ground floor.",

        "description": "To celebrate summer, come out for reading by three great writers! Karen Dudley and Robin Riopelle have new novels out and Scott Fotheringham  is the author of the acclaimed novel THE REST IS SILENCE.\n\nKAREN DUDLEY didn\u2019t know she was supposed to be a writer, so she studied everything from Greek history to ecology to Quaternary pollen analysis. Then she wrote a short stack of wildlife biology books and four environmental mystery novels before she decided that maybe she should be writing fantasy. Her first fantasy, Food for the Gods, was nominated for five awards including an Prix Aurora award for Best Science Fiction and Fantasy Novel, a Bony Blithe Bloody Words Light Mystery award, and a High Plains book award in the Culinary Division. She will be reading from Kraken Bake, the newly-published sequel to Food for the Gods.\n\nBorn in Ottawa and raised on Canada\u2019s west coast, ROBIN RIOPELLE\u2019s life has been marked by adoption, separation, and reunion. Like many of her characters, she has a muddy past and a foot in (at least) two different worlds. She currently lives on the border between French and English Canada with her criminologist husband, two seemingly delightful children, and an obstreperous spaniel. She is a great supporter of the Oxford comma.\n\nIn addition to writing fiction for adults, Riopelle also illustrates children\u2019s books. Deadroads is her first novel.\n\n\nSCOT T FOTHERINGHAM holds a PhD in molecular biology and genetics from Cornell University. He has co-authored scientific articles on molecular genetics, and closely studied the mechanisms of recombination using genetically engineered fungi, bacteria, and fruit flies. His first novel, The Rest Is Silence, was short-listed for the Amazon First Novel Award, Dartmouth Book Award, and an Ottawa Book Award. Raised in Thornhill, Scott now lives and writes just outside Ottawa where he is working on his second novel.",

Despite several democratic setbacks, as well as an escalated climate of violence and repression in Honduras, the Canadian government has only deepened its political support for, as well as economic ties with the Central American country. A trade deal between Canada and Honduras, signed in November 2013 and currently being pushed through parliament, risks exacerbating an already dire situation, putting investor rights head of community rights.\n\nHosted by the Americas Policy Group (Canadian Council for International Cooperation), PSAC Social Justice Fund and Canadian Union of Public Employees.\n\nThis is part of the Building Solidarity with Honduras Tour: Peoples' Rights over Corporate Rights.

Elle est \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s bonne du point de vue s\u00e9curitaire sur l\u2019ensemble du territoire national. La r\u00e9conciliation entre les composantes ethniques et politiques du pays, amorc\u00e9e depuis 2005, progresse d\u2019une fa\u00e7on positive.\nLa situation politique de ces derniers mois a pourtant \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e par un climat de suspicion aliment\u00e9 par certains burundais et \u00e9trangers aux intentions douteuses, qui sont all\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 brandir le spectre d\u2019un pr\u00e9tendu g\u00e9nocide imminent. Voulant attiser la haine du pass\u00e9e entre les Burundais, leurs motifs ne sont pas encore connus quoique l\u2019on puisse pr\u00e9sumer qu\u2019ils \u00e9prouvent des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 gagner du terrain aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019\u00e9lectorat burundais.\nNotre marche pour la paix vise \u00e0 d\u00e9noncer ce comportement et \u00e0 souligner l\u2019\u00e9volution positive du Burundi vers la paix et la r\u00e9conciliation. Venez donc nombreux et \u00abmarchons pour la paix au Burundi\u00bb !\nTh\u00e8mes de la manifestation\n- Nous refusons que la Diaspora burundaise \u00e0 travers le monde et les Burundais de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur soient instrumentalis\u00e9s par certains politiciens et des \u00e9trangers au risque de mettre en danger les acquis de la d\u00e9mocratie au Burundi\n- Nous refusons l\u2019usage biais\u00e9 et abusif du mot g\u00e9nocide sur le Burundi, ni par les Nations Unies ni par certains acteurs politiques burundais\n- Nous r\u00e9it\u00e9rons vivement notre soutien \u00e0 toutes les actions positives du gouvernement burundais\n- Nous disons OUI \u00e0 la CNTB pour r\u00e9habiliter les sinistr\u00e9s et rapatri\u00e9s burundais dans leurs droits\n- OUI \u00e0 un BNUB impartial\n- OUI \u00e0 l\u2019aide internationale pour le d\u00e9veloppement par les partenaires internationaux\n- VIVE le Burundi qui contribue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de l\u2019\u00c9tat de Droit dans certaines parties du monde (Somalie, R\u00e9publique Centre-Africaine, Ha\u00efti, Soudan du Sud)\n- NON aux sabotages, aux paralysies des actions gouvernementales\n- Oui \u00e0 la d\u00e9mocratie qui est le gouvernement du peuple,par le peuple et pour le peuple\n- Nous disons PLUS JAMAIS les coups d\u2019\u00c9tat et les massacres comme en 1965, 1972, 1988, 1993 !!!\n- OUI \u00e0 une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 civile apolitique et impartiale\n- NON \u00e0 l\u2019ing\u00e9rence ext\u00e9rieure\n\nFait \u00e0 Ottawa le 26-04-2014\nPour les organisateurs de la manifestation:\nErnest Mbanzendore et David Daudi Niyonsaba Niyomwungere",

There are masks from the States of Hidalgo, Guerrero, Chiapas, Puebla, Jalisco, Sonora , Nayarit, Queretaro, Guanajuato, Michoac\u00e1n and other places that somehow have survived the accelerated pace of the country. We see animals that transform the dancer into a fierce tiger or a shy rabbit ,we see moors and Christians that are loaded with the religious background imposed to the Mexican people in colonial times, and other characters full of humor, anguish , desire, happiness, guilt, and any other human vulnerability that can be expressed through this fantastic form of art.\n\nThe Muyaes Ogazon collection of traditional Mexican masks was put together by Professor Estela Ogazon and the anthropologist Jaled Muyaes throughout more than 50 years. They dedicated their lives to the rescue of Mexican culture emphasizing their energy in the fascinating world of the Mexican dances and celebrations which use masks. The collection is composed by about 3000 masks all of which have been used in the celebrations which makes them unique pieces filled with a life of their own. They focused specially in the aesthetics of the objet but always made sure to have all the ethnographic information that a serious collection requires.\nThey travelled all over Mexico ,attended the celebrations in the small towns, some at Christmas time, some at Easter, others celebrating the Patron saint of the communities, some other ritual, like in the State of Nayarit and Sonora. But always regarding these festivities with great respect and admiration, praising the traditions that have lasted throughout centuries and that other countries like the one this collection is visiting now, have to offer to the world.\n\nOur indigenous people have defended their traditions with passion, they show us what we are with their incredibly artistic expressions like the masks, where we come from and where we could go with their legacy. \n\nOur legacy.\n\nSee more: http://www.lapetitemortgallery.com/embassy-of-mexico-june-2014/\n\n \n\n                                     Gracias.",

        "description": "Join us for the launch of Min Fami: Arab Feminist Reflections on Identity, Space, and Resistance (Inanna Publications), an exciting new anthology edited by Ghadeer Malek and Ghaida Moussa, featuring over 30 contributor's poetry, short stories, critical reflections, academic work, and visual art by Arab feminists from across the world.\n\nWe are coming to Ottawa to celebrate the release of the book after 3 years of heart, soul, longing, (and lots of long nights!). \n\nAlong with selected readings from the book, the evening will include special guest performances by Myron and Sibylle Rym Ben Berrah, and Maha Zimmo! No Arab celebration would be complete without good food and good conversation!\n\nThis event is free, and all are welcome!\n\nAccessibility Note:\n\nVenus Envy is wheelchair accessible.\nSeating is limited but there will be standing room, and some floor seating, but let us know if you need a seat reserved.\nIf there are any ways we can make this event more accessible to you, please let us know as soon as you can by calling 613 789 4646.\n\nMore about the book:\n\nMin Fami: Arab Feminist Reflections on Identity, Space, and Resistance is an anthology that cradles the thoughts of Arab feminists, articulated through personal critical narratives, academic essays, poetry, short stories, and visual art. It is a meeting space where discussions on home(land), exile, feminism, borders, gender and sexual identity, solidarity, language, creative resistance, and (de)colonization are shared, confronted, and subverted. In a world that has increasingly found monolithic and one-dimensional ways of representing Arab womyn, this anthology comes as an alternate space in which we connect on the basis of our shared identities, despite physical, theoretical, and metaphorical distances, to celebrate our multiple voices, honour our ancestry, and build community on our own terms, and in our own voices. Pre-order is now available online: https://www.inanna.ca/index.php/catalog/min-fami-arab-feminist-reflections-identity-space-and-resistance/\n\nAbout the editors:\n\nGhadeer Malek is a Palestinian feminist activist, aspiring writer and spoken word poet. She immigrated to Toronto in 2003 to study at the University of Toronto and graduated with an honours bachelor degree in History and Middle Eastern studies after which she joined the Association of Women\u2019s Right in Development (AWID). She currently coordinates the Young Feminist Activism (YFA) Program at AWID and is pursuing a Master\u2019s degree at OISE/UT. Ghadeer is also a co-founder and editor of Aqsazine, an art collective of young progressive and critical Muslim women passionate about combating gender-based violence through art. Ghadeer\u2019s poetry has been published in Feminism for real and Shameless Magazine. \n\nGhaida Moussa is a scholar, educator, and dj, who is passionately drawn to creative articulations of resistance, identity, memory, and space. She holds a bi-disciplinary Master\u2019s degree in International Development and Global Studies, and Women\u2019s Studies from the University of Ottawa. She is currently undertaking her Ph.D. in Social and Political Thought at York University in Toronto, Canada. The past couple of years, she has been devoted to translating anti-colonial notions onto dance floors, thinking through \u201chome\u201d in the cracks between anchored locations and collective memory, and practicing pedagogy from the heart in the classroom and in alternate spaces of education.\n\n\nAbout the performers:\n\nRym Ben Berrah, Sibylle de surnom, est une \u00e9tudiante en autisme et en psychologie. Originaire de l'Afrique du Nord, Tuniso-Alg\u00e9rienne, elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al durant son adolescence et partage le reste de sa vie entre Ottawa, Montr\u00e9al et nouvellement Toronto. R\u00e9cipiendaire de nombreux prix d'\u00e9criture de nouvelles, de slam et de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, elle se sp\u00e9cialise dans l'art de la sc\u00e8ne depuis 2008. Ses inspirations sont diverses, mais le tout est sibyllin, rythm\u00e9 de douceur et de v\u00e9racit\u00e9.\n\nMaha Zimmo family came to Canada when she was aged four and still malleable to her parents' will. They are Muslim, Palestinian and she was born in Libya; essentially, her identity is where all Axis of Evil points converse. March 29th marks her ten year anniversary as writer at / owner of Prolific Immigrant (onefemalecanuck.com); she has completed Middle Eastern news analysis for several progressive news teams such as Rabble. She is currently the resident 'Know-It-All' advice columnist at both Elle Beaver - where Canadian feminists discuss issues and challenge one another, and everyone else - and at Chai Latte Diaries.",

Three local storytellers explore the intersection of memory, emotion, and change in neighbourhoods across Ottawa. We will hear from Centretown\u2019s David O\u2019Meara, award-winning poet, flaneur and bartender at local institution, the Manx Pub; Dennis Van Staalduinen, who will bring to life the stories contained in oak trees that are the living monuments of his neighbourhood, Champlain Park; and Alain Miguelez, an urban planner for the city and author of a book on the Ottawa\u2019s all-but-forgotten cinemas.\n\nBefore the storytelling begins, come experience \u201cOttawa in One Room,\u201d a video installation by local artists Jessica Aylsworth and Jon Booth. Their work evokes the shared memories of strangers as viewers are immersed in a whimsical space filled with scenes of Ottawa neighbourhoods projected onto floating panels of translucent fabric.\n\nJoin us afterwards to share treats and your own tales of Neighbourhood Narratives!\n\nJane\u2019s Talk 2014: Neighbourhood Narratives is made possible through the generosity of the Downtown Rideau Business Improvement Area.\n\nJane's Walk Ottawa, a festival of 50+ free, citizen-led walking tours, takes place May 3-4. See the schedule at: http://www.janeswalkottawa.ca/sessions/4\n\n\"Ottawa in One Room\" will be on all weekend, so visit Arts Court throughout Jane's Walk to check out the installation, grab some refreshment an hang out at Arts Court - the 2014 hub for Jane's Walk!\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpeakers:\n\nJessica Aylsworth is a multi-media artist. Her work focuses on drawing and fabric, but has increasingly been blending a wider range of mediums and genres, weaving together drawing, fabric, photography, projection, sound, and more. Her collaborator, Jon Booth, is self-taught sound artist. He has created pieces ranging from orchestral arrangements to piano rags to more abstract sound compositions. Although they work in very different mediums, they both like to explore the concepts of memory and identity in their works.\n\nDavid O'Meara is the author of four collections of poetry, including most recently \u201cA Pretty Sight\u201d and a play, \u201cDisaster,\u201d nominated for four Rideau Awards. His poetry has been shortlisted for the Gerald Lampert Award, the ReLit Award, the Trillium Book Award, a National Magazine Award, and he has won the Archibald Lampman Award twice. He is the director of the Plan 99 Reading Series, Artistic Director of VERSEFest and was the Canadian judge for the 2012 Griffin Poetry Prize.\n\nFourth-year Jane\u2019s Walk leader Dennis Van Staalduinen once thought that his neighbourhood of Champlain Park was boring, until a series of encounters with real living remnants of history led him to dig deeper, and learn much more about the characters, the urban planning choices, and the ancient Champlain Oak trees around him.\n\nAlain Miguelez is an urban planner with the City of Ottawa and the author of A Theatre Near You.  Alain lives in Sandy Hill and has lived there, off and on, since his teenage years.  He likes that it\u2019s such a good walking neighbourhood, that it\u2019s close to everything, has nice old buildings, and that it\u2019s so alive with the youthful energy of students.",

Une amie qui habite \u00e0 Hull, m'a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir un \u00e9v\u00e9nement chez elle, soit \u00e9galement un endroit o\u00f9 il se d\u00e9roule r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des cours de m\u00e9ditation dans cette r\u00e9gion. Comme tous les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d'Alignement Alpha, l'ambiance sera d'avantage amicale que formelle. \n\nL'Alignement Alpha agit sur les niveaux physique, mental, \u00e9motionnel, spirituel, structurel, musculaire, vasculaire et chimique. Il se focalise sur la bonne relation entre le corps et l'esprit, et comment cette interrelation peut affecter nos fonctions vitales et notre performance humaine dans tous les domaines de notre vie. C'est un processus ...par lequel les blocages et les restrictions de la bonne circulation de l'\u00e9nergie vitale (Life Energy) sont temporairement retir\u00e9es, permettant ainsi \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie de s'\u00e9couler plus librement dans toutes les parties du corps. En cons\u00e9quence, vous retrouvez le bien-\u00eatre, la bonne humeur et la joie de vivre que vous aviez du temps de votre enfance.\n\nLorsque vous \u00eates calmes, votre intelligence inn\u00e9e travaille pour vous en temps r\u00e9el, dans l'instant pr\u00e9sent, de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e et naturelle, d'une fa\u00e7on qui peut vous emp\u00eacher de vivre dans l'agitation excessive des pens\u00e9es, de r\u00e9agir de fa\u00e7on exag\u00e9r\u00e9es aux formes de stress subtiles, aux situations n\u00e9gatives de la vie et de se replier dans un monde isol\u00e9 parce que le cerveau est verrouill\u00e9. L'Alignement Alpha offre un moyen de r\u00e9soudre les difficult\u00e9s de votre vie et de r\u00e9aliser pleinement votre potentiel. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle le rythme alpha, qui sont des ondes plus douces et relaxantes.\n\nJ'invite mes ami(e)s \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir l'Alignement Alpha. Vous aurez l'occasion d'exp\u00e9rimenter un \u00e9tat d'\u00eatre \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique nouveau gr\u00e2ce aux ondes alpha et la possibilit\u00e9 de vous sentir diff\u00e9rent, plus positif et plus heureux.\n\nVoici les commentaires des amis qui exp\u00e9rimentent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement l'alignement alpha : http://www.alignementalpha.ca/#!les-commentaires-des-amis/cqaz\n\nUne pr\u00e9sentation d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de l'Alignement Alpha ici :\nhttp://www.alignementalpha.ca/#!Une-prsentation-dtaille-de-lAlignement-Alpha/cpz2/1\n_____________________________________________________\nD\u00e9tails de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement du 18 avril:\n\nPour les nouveaux \u00e0 l'Alignement Alpha, il y aura 2 opportunit\u00e9s de participer dans la m\u00eame journ\u00e9e (2 groupes): Une s\u00e9ance d'information obligatoire suivie d\u2019alignements aura lieu \u00e0 13:00.

But the reality is, not everyone is as fortunate as us. Last year, as I was wrapping my homemade scarf around my neck, I started thinking about how I could do something for those who don't have the luxury of warmth and can't afford a Canada Goose jacket.\n\nAs some of you know, I crochet a lot \u2013 scarves in particular.Last winter I had decided to sell my scarves. For every scarf that I make and sell, I am going to make another scarf to donate to a homeless person. If you are familiar with Toms shoes, it\u2019s basically the same idea \u2013 but instead, you will be helping someone right here in Ontario! So, not only will you be keeping yourself warm, but you will also be helping someone on the streets stay warm.\n\n I can make your personal scarf with any colour you\u2019d like.  I can also make infinity/circle scarves. If you would like anything fancier it will cost a little more.\nEach scarf costs $20.  I make them approx. 56 inches in length. \n\nIf you are interested in buying a scarf, send me a personal message. here is the link to the colours you can choose from for your scarf. \nhttp://store.knitting-warehouse.com/yarn-lion-homespun.html\n\nThanks so much for your help with my project!\nIt Feels Warm to Give <3\n\n\nKailey \nhttps://twitter.com/Kailewlew",

In 2009 he toured with Mother Mother, and opened for Adele in front of a sold-out audience at Toronto's Massey Hall. In the summer of 2011, he released a self-produced EP You've Heard the Best, Now Try the Rest... With another well-received release under his belt, he continued to build an audience and make waves, touring around Quebec and Ontario. In 2012, he spend most of the year in pre-production for his next full-length album which he just finished recording at Break Glass Studios with producer and Besnard Lakes frontman, Jace Lasek (Land of Talk, Suuns).

The winner of the Ottawa Final will compete in the 2014 National Championship.\n\nCongratulations to Richard Morrissette, winner of February's Art Battle 99!  Here is the review of his win and the event in the Ottawa Citizen > http://www.ottawacitizen.com/mobile/news/ottawa/Battle+Ottawa/9540790/story.html\n\nTo paint with Art Battle in Ottawa or another city, please visit our application page at http://artbattle.ca/register\n\nOur promotional partners, the AOE Arts Council (AOE) have been serving the Ottawa arts community for 25 years. AOE represents a bilingual membership of over 450 artists, organizations and supporters. Visit www.artsoe.ca to learn more.\n\nWHAT IS ART BATTLE?\n\nArt Battle is live competitive painting. Painters create the best work they can in 20 minutes. As they work, patrons move around the easels, closely watching the creative process. The medium is acrylic paint and the tools allowed are brushes, palette knives or any non-mechanical implements. At the end of the round, the audience votes democratically for their favourite painting and bids in silent auction to take the work home. This is Art Battle Canada\u2019s 5th season and first full season in Ottawa.\n\nArt Battle 111\nSaturday, March 29th 7pm\nArts Court, 2 Daly Ave\nTickets 15$ door/10$ Limited Advance online\n$10 at the door for Students and Seniors",

They've played festivals like POUZZA FEST, AMNESIA  ROCKFEST, and have played shows with such bands as DIRECT HIT!, MASKED INTRUDER, SNUFF, STRUNG OUT, THE FLATLINERS, and too many more to name. \nThey released their album \"Cour ou Creve\" (Run or Die) in 2012 and it earned them the GAMIQ award in 2013 for best independent punk album of the year in Quebec, and considering the insane amount of amazing punk bands in Quebec that's pretty impressive.  They'll be back at POUZZA FEST 4 in MONTREAL MAY 16-18 and continue to win new fans wherever they play, so come check them on these Ontario dates:\n\nTHURS APRIL 10 - OTTAWA @ CAFE LUNETTA\nw/ FRESH HELL + SLING POPS+RICH CHRIS\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/251251145055484/?ref=23\nPresented by: Richard Barrie\n\nFRI APRIL 11 - OSHAWA @ THE ATRIA\nw/ THE MAD MURDOCKS + PLAN 37 + THE CORPORATE LIFE\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1415939478656885/?ref=5\nPresented by: MLAunderground\n\nSAT APRIL 12 - TORONTO @ THE BOVINE\nw/ The Readys + Reminder + Owen Wilson\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/727228663964354/?ref=23\nPresented by: 112 Productions + People Put Out Productions\n\nSUN APRIL 13 - GUELPH @ THE RED PAPAYA\nW/ QUAID\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/232531120280980/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming\n\nMON APRIL 14 - PETERBOROUGH @ THE SPILL\nw/ BROKEN FOOT + NIALL JENSON\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/719279764772375/?ref=5\nPresented by: MLAunderground\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPOUZZA FEST www.pouzzafest.com/ happens May 16-18 2014 in downtown Montreal and is one of the coolest fests around for punk rock fans. The fest takes over multiple venues in downtown Montreal and the 4th edition features some incredible bands.  DILLINGER FOUR, CHIXDIGGIT, MAD CADDIES, SNFU, DAYGLO ABORTIONS, REAGAN YOUTH, 7 SECONDS, CJ RAMONE, THE MENZINGERS, THE FLATLINERS, THE BRAINS, MUSTARD PLUG, THE HOLY MESS, and too many more to mention here. So check out the website for all the bands, the schedules, and book a hotel because it's going to be good.\n\nMLAunderground Productions puts on punk shows in Oshawa and Peterborough and also in other places too. The goal is always to book bands I like and do what I can to get people to hear them and to try to quietly crusade against mainstream crap and promote the underground.  If you like going to shows and are in these areas or passing through you should see what we've got going on.  If your in a band and are passing through this way and thinking you might want to do a show somewhere, then just send me a message.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------Please check out these other great bands and individuals:\n\n112 PRODUCTIONS / https://www.facebook.com/112productions\n\nPEOPLE PUT OUT PRODUCTIONS / \nhttps://www.facebook.com/peopleputout\n\nTHE MAD MURDOCKS/WHITBY****Appearing at POUZZA FEST 4\nhttps://www.facebook.com/themadmurdocks\n\nPLAN 37/TORONTO*****Appearing at POUZZA FEST 4\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Plan37\n\nTHE CORPORATE LIFE/NEWCASTLE\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thecorporatelife\n\nFRESH HELL/OTTAWA\nhttps://www.facebook.com/freshhellottawa\n\nTHE SLING POPS/BRAMPTON\n\nBROKEN FOOT/PETERBOROUGH\nhttps://www.facebook.com/brokenfootpeterborough\n\nTHE READYS/NEWMARKET\nhttp://www.facebook.com/werethereadys\n\nRICH CHRIS/OTTAWA\nhttp://www.richchris.bandcamp.com/",

To order in Canada, please visit: http://fernwoodpublishing.ca/Crises-of-Imagination-Crises-of-Power/ \n\nABOUT THE BOOK\n\nhttp://www.zedbooks.co.uk/paperback/crises-of-imagination-crises-of-power\n\n\"Today, when it seems like everything has been privatized, when austerity is too often seen as an economic or political problem that can be solved through better policy, and when the idea of moral values has been commandeered by the right, how can we re-imagine the forces used as weapons against community, solidarity, ecology and life itself?\n\nIn this stirring call to arms, Max Haiven argues that capitalism has colonized how we all imagine and express what is valuable. Looking at the decline of the public sphere, the corporatization of education, the privatization of creativity, and the power of finance capital in opposition to the power of the imagination and the growth of contemporary social movements, Haiven provides a powerful argument for creating an anti-capitalist commons. Capitalism is not in crisis, it is the crisis, and moving beyond it is the only key to survival.\n\nCrucial reading for all those questioning the imposition of austerity and hoping for a fairer future beyond it.\"\n\nFree and open to all\n\nMax Haiven is an assistant professor in the Division of Art History and Critical Studies at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax. His work has appeared in journals such as Social Text, Cultural Studies, and Mediations. He is the author of Cultures of Financialization (2014) and (with Alex Khasnabish) of The Radical Imagination (Zed Books, 2014).",

He cast himself as the ultimate insider, Parliament Hill\u2019s man in the know. It made him a household name and one of the Canada\u2019s best-paid journalists. \n\nBut Duffy wanted to get even closer and lobbied his way into the Canadian Senate, with dire results. Veteran journalist Dan Leger tells the story of Duffy\u2019s rise to the top in Canadian media, his entanglement with the Harper Conservatives, and the scandal that made him one of the most controversial figures in contemporary politics. \n\nIncludes a foreword by CBC\u2019s Peter Mansbridge and an eight-page colour photo insert. \n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\n\nDan Leger is one of Canada's most versatile journalists. After 12 years reporting for the Canadian Press in Halifax, St. John's, and on Parliament Hill, he moved to the CBC as a producer and executive producer. In 2005, he joined The Chronicle Herald as managing editor and columnist. He is a Gemini Award winner, and holds two Atlantic Journalism Awards for Commentary.",

The University of Ottawa is a signatory to this international agreement. We would sincerely appreciate your voice as a distinguished professional and expert in this industry.\n\nLocation:\n4101 (4th floor) Desmarais Building, (DMS) - University Of Ottawa - 55 Laurier East Ottawa, Ontario, K1N 6N5\n\nWe would like to thank the Graduate Student Association (GSAED), OPIRG (Ontario Public Interest Research Group Ottawa), the School of Management, the Political Studies Department and the Association des \u00e9tudiant(e)s dipl\u00f4m\u00e9(e)s en \u00e9tudes politiques.\n\n****\n\nSOCIAL FINANCE AND ETHICAL INVESTMENTS\nThe boundaries between public and private are blurring with the responsibilities of social development no longer in the hands of government. It is inappropriate for the private sector to safely hide behind Milton Friedman\u2019s assertion that \u201c\u2026 the only social responsibility of business is to increase its profits \u2026\u201d1 The students of University of Ottawa are interested in alternative investment options that take into account social and ethical considerations. In the last several decades social finance and ethical investment have become increasingly important and sought after investment methods. For example portfolios with social investment started as early as 1984, which according to the Social Investment Forum worth around 40 billion. A decade later this number grew to $639 billion, while in 2001 it was $2.3 trillion.2 Around the world funds have been organized in national settings like the Pay for Success, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation in the United States.\n\n\n1.Milton Friedman, Greed is Good, the Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits, NEW YORK TIMES, 13 September 1970\n2.Florini, A., 2003. \u2018Business and global governance: the growing role of corporate codes of conduct\u2019, Brookings Review 21 (3)\n\nETHICAL INVESTING AND SOCIAL FINANCE\nAmerica by the new Eduniversal 2013-2014 Masters ranking in the General Management category. The university has made breakthrough advancements in the fields of sciences, social sciences, and health on the global setting. The University`s proximity to Parliament and other national institutions gives it an important role in the formation of developing Canadian policy. Due to Ottawa`s meteoritic rise and commitments to justice there is demand for pursuing socially equitable and progressive Financial policies.\n\n\nFormat of Event\nProminent and distinguished experts will be invited to answer a number of questions moderated by Associate Professor Penelope Simons. Upon the conclusion of the questions, the audience will be encouraged to ask questions. The event will end with a fully catered networking event. \n\nFor more information, please contact Ana\u00efs Elboujda\u00efni, Student Member of the University of Ottawa, Board of Governors at anaiselboujdaini@gmail.com",

The Tea Light Concert Series is a monthly showcase that features artists who've played the open mic and who have demonstrated true skill and talent over the years and who simply deserve more spotlight.\n\nJoin us for our second event, April 10th!!\n\nFeaturing:\n\nJust Friends \n(Jeff & Dave Watkins, Sara Baar) A harmony of voices, instruments, friends, and fun sing songs. \"\n\nAndrew Johnson\nhttp://www.reverbnation.com/andrewjohnsonmusic\n\nAndrew Johnson is an artist singer/songwriter originally from the Ottawa Valley. Spiralling straightforward, full of 'soul' folk music - a psychedelic experience. He is currently working with several producers as well as with a band of wide variety, an eclectic collective of like minded musicians, a powerhouse of potential creating a poetic symphony for the senses. Introducing a unique fusion of the many styles and genres that shape our creative outlook of today and focusing on a new direction with his projects, Andrew is working towards a sustainable community and being able to share the feeling with the world\n\nMark Fossen\nhttp://www.markfossen.com/\n\nIn the summer of 2009, Fossen left his suburban nine-to-five and moved into the heart of Vancouver's creative district with a clean slate, a guitar, and an optimistic uncertainty that this was to be his best decision to date.\n\nFor the next three years, he would spend his days transforming busy street corners into peaceful listening stations and romantic piers into intimate stages\u2014one street performance at a time.\n\nFunded through the generous support of passersby, Fossen produced and released his debut EP \"Villains\" in December of 2011, which features a collection of songs from this period spent singing on the world's sidewalks. He is happy to know that people all over the globe are in possession of his music today.\n\nNow residing in Ottawa, he is presently preparing his next release with the help of engineer/producer Dave Meszaros of Watershed Productions in Vancouver.  - See more at: http://www.markfossen.com/bio/#sthash.v6Sgi8q1.dpuf\n\n$7  //   75 Nicholas \nDoors 8pm // Show starts at 9pm\nThursday, April 10th 2014\n\nSee you Thursday!!\nSincerely,\nClaude Munson",

Frassati & St. Joe's are there for you! The APB PARTY is back! With a new theme... FRIENDS (cue IMDB for anyone born after '95)!\n\nFriends are important - they're those people who tell you the honest truth about yourself, such as: \n- you look ugly in in plaid\n- that cold sore can't be passed of as a mole\n- that horrible smell in the room is actually coming from you \n- everyone knows you have a crush on Matt Marchand!\n\nIf you have such people in your life, then do them a favour by inviting them to the LAST EVER APB HOSTED BY FRASSATI & ST. JOES! That's right, St. Joe's will be closing their doors once & for all this May! Hence why we picked the long-running sitcom as the theme.\n\nIf your friends have kept you in the dark and you've never been to a Frassati/St. Joe's party, you can expect live music, a loud dance floor and of course, one large, roasted PIG! \n\nWe're going to shut St. Joe's down in style and we want you to join us! Because we'll always be there for you... or at least until end of the month...\n\nSo help us BLOW UP  this BLOW OUT event, 'cause it's gonna be... FRIENDLY!\n\n**This is a BYOB event.

This program is made possible with the support of the uOttawa administration and the World University Service of Canada (WUSC).  Most importantly, it is made possible by the $1.27 student levy every uOttawa student contributes each year to the SRP.\n\nNext year, we would like to generate enough support to raise the student levy, so that uOttawa can sponsor additional refugees to come and study, and so that we can become a leading Canadian university with a well recognized and respected Student Refugee Program.  This will not be possible without bringing more attention to the SRP, which began back in 1988, and has already changed the lives of dozens of youth refugees.\n\nPlease stop by sometime between 11 am and 3 pm March 18-20 to learn more about this great program, and how raising the student levy will help ensure its success.",

David's usual set up includes 10-12 Quartz Crystal Bowls, 8-10 Paiste Planet Gongs &  Santoor (Persian & Indian) Nothing is amplified, pre-recorded or rehearsed. Each set and performance is sonically pure and unique. You can purchase CDs and other merchandise at the shows with cash or cheque or online with a credit card.\n\nWe invite you to take a seat or lay down as close to the instruments as possible to get the greatest effect. Remember to bring a yoga mat, blanket and/or pillow as most venues will have floor space to lay down. Chairs for regular seating are also available. Where possible we encourage you to share rides and car pool. It not only saves gas but helps to reduce our carbon foot print on the earth and traffic.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nAbout The Instruments:\n\n\nPaiste Gongs:\n\nPlanet Gongs are tuned to the natural harmonic series based on the orbital properties of the Earth, Moon, Sun, and Planets. All of these gongs resonate in harmony with the celestial bodies and communicate a distinct aspect of the Music of the Spheres, which was first documented by Pythagoras in the 6th Century BC. Each planet gong contributes a vital pitch to the total harmonic resonance of our solar system.\n\nCrystal Bowls:\n\nThe bowls are made of 99.992% crushed quartz crystal that is heated to 4000 degrees in a centrifugal mold. The thickness of the bowl determines the note, digitally tuned to C D E F G A and B corresponding to the charkas, our energy centers; root (C), sacral (D), solar plexus (E), heart (F), throat (G), third eye (A), and crown (B). The diameter of the bowl determines the pitch, ranging from 6 inches to 22 inches.\n\nThe archetype of the instrument may be seen in a harp, carried horizontally and struck with two sticks, found in iconographical documents of the ancient Babylonian (1600-911 BCE) and neo-Assyrian (911-612 BCE) eras.\n\nIndian Santoor (Santour)\n\nThe origin of the instrument is clear.  The name, structure, and technique point solidly to the Middle East.  Yet, there are those who attempt to trace its origins to an ancient Indian harp like instrument known as \"Vana Veena\".  There is absolutely no evidence for this latter view.  If we are to accept this proposition, then how are we to explain its 2000 year disappearance, followed by a miraculous reappearance in a form and usage that, by mere coincidence, is similar to the middle eastern santur?  It is clear that attempts to link the santur with this Vedic instrument are mere wishful thinking.  There are many people who cannot accept the concept of something great developing outside of India.\n\nSantur is an instrument indigenous to Kashmir, but nowadays played throughout the North.  It is a hammered dulcimer which is struck with light wooden mallets.  The number of strings may be as few as 24 or more than 100.  Typical sizes tend to be around 80.  It has a vibrant tone and has become very popular in the last 20 years.\n\nOne must not confuse the Indian santur with the Persian santur.  The Indian santur is box-like while the Persian version is much wider.\n\nPersian Santoor:\n\nPersian santoor consists of a trapeziform case made of walnut wood, approximately 90 cm wide at the broad end, 36 cm wide at the narrow end and 6 cm deep. The strings are fixed to hitch-pins along the left-hand side and wound round metal wrest-pins on the right by means of which they are tuned with a tuning-key (Tuning Wrench). Each quadruple set of strings rests on a movable bridge of hardwood (kharak). The bridges are placed so that the strings are divided into three sections, giving the fundamental note and two higher octaves.\n\nThere are nine (or sometimes 10, 11 and 12) quadruple strings an either side so that, with 18 groups of strings, 27 different notes can be played. The bass strings are of brass or copper and the trebles of steel.\n\nPersian santoor is played by striking the strings with two light hammers (mezrab) held in three fingers of each hand. The ends of the sticks are usually covered with cloth to soften their impact on the strings.",

GILES PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, Banquet Hall.\n174 First Avenue, in the Glebe.\n\nSaturday & Sunday 3th & 4th May 2014\nMONTREAL\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/616344531731063\n\nThis two day workshop, taught by Miranda Gray, will enable women to work with the blessing energy directly and give a \u2018hands on\u2019 version of the Womb Blessing and Womb Healing.\nhttp://www.wombblessing.com/eng-workshops.html\n\nWorkshop early bird price $320 by April 15th*, $370 after. Deposit of $70.\n(*new date!)\n\n\u2018Moon Mothers\u2019 are women who have taken the \u2018Moon Mother\u2019 initiation personally from Miranda Gray at a Womb Blessing Training Workshop. This raises them to the high vibrational level required for them to give the transformative Womb Blessing and Womb Healing Attunement in person. The energy works to heal the three main female energy centres; the brow, the heart and the womb and the four female archetypes; the maiden, the mother, the maga and the crone. Think of the \u2018Moon Mother initiation\u2019 as a Priestess or Master initiation.\n\n\u2018Moon Mothers\u2019 are healers, combining the Womb Blessing and Womb Healing with other therapies. They are priestesses and celebrants, helping girls and women through their rites of passage, and they are companions in women\u2019s lives and on their spiritual paths. They can take an active role in spreading the Womb Blessing energy and take part in the worldwide events.\n\nThe Womb Blessing is deeply transformational and available to all women.\n\nThe Worldwide Womb Blessing events are growing in size. The Blessing in August 2013 had more than 53,000 women in 80 countries. More and more women are wishing to connect and deepen their experience of the 'authentic feminine'.\n\nMoon Mother Louise Hayden, WiseWomanWellWoman, is delighted to be hosting this event in Ottawa with Miranda Gray. \nLouise offers WiseWoman healing sessions, as womb blessing attunements & circles, and teaches regular workshops in Ottawa/Gatineau. She also hosts the Ottawa Red Tent.\nwww.wisewomanwellwoman.ca\n\nThis workshop is also being held in May in Montreal;\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/616344531731063\nand Toronto\nhttp://www.wombblessing.com/calendar.html\n\nIf you feel called to join us for this profound work please email;\ninfolouisehayden@gmail.com (Louise - Ottawa)\ninfo@atelierdesames.com (Catalina - Montreal)\nlkevic@gmail.com (Lana - Toronto)",

Teams of 3-5 adults and children will race across downtown Ottawa with the goal of winning the coveted first prize trophy (and other prizes). Clues will aid participants to deepen their knowledge about this wonderful city. \n\nThe Scavenger Hunt will take place on Saturday May 31, 2014 at 2pm, with registration beginning at 1:30pm, at the First Baptist Church, at the corner of Laurier and Elgin (140 Laurier Avenue West). Cost is $5 per person or $20 per team. Registration can also be done online through PayPal, which will add to our website soon. \n\nFollowing the event, participants will be able to enjoy a post-event celebration at D'Arcy McGees at Metcalfe and Sparks, where the prizes will be distributed and food enjoyed. \n\nSee you there!",

It\u2019s this annual mecca of bargain-hunters from near and far that gave birth to Ecology Ottawa\u2019s Great Glebe GREEN Garage Sale!\n\nTo help make the Great Glebe GREEN Garage Sale a success, we are actively looking for people who want to donate their unwanted stuff, volunteers of all ages, and folks who want to contribute yummy treats to our bake sale. \n\nVisit http://ecologyottawa.ca/garage-sale/ to learn more about how you can support this fun and important community event.\n\nABOUT\n\nNow in its 7th year, the Great Glebe GREEN Garage Sale has become one of Ecology Ottawa\u2019s flagship annual events. What started as a humble fundraiser in 2008 has grown into a massive event that\u2014in addition to the garage sale itself\u2014now features a vegetarian BBQ (join us for lunch), a bake sale (including hot coffee at the crack of dawn), and live musical performances.\n\nWe also have massage therapists (to help you relax after a long day of shopping), fun activities for kids of all ages, and much, much more!\n\nBack by popular demand, we will also have a water bottle refilling station on site, as well as portable public washrooms for the community\u2019s use (when nature calls).\n\nThe event has raised over $40,000 to date. All items sold at the event are collected from over 200 supporters from across the city, and all proceeds raised go to charity (90% to Ecology Ottawa, 10% to The Ottawa Food Bank). Everything is coordinated by more than 100 passionate volunteers, without whom this event would not be possible.\n\nThis event is part of the community-wide Great Glebe Garage Sale that takes place across the neighbourhood, organized by the Glebe Community Association.\n\nFor more info, please visit our web site at http://ecologyottawa.ca/garage-sale/.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nVotre temps pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 de l\u2019ann\u00e9e approche\u2026 Bient\u00f4t tout le Glebe s\u2019animera au pas des gens venus \u00e9pier les pelouses comme jamais auparavant.

I have had three incredibly wonderful natural home birth experiences in 2006, 2009, and 2011. I have supported many women through pregnancy and birth. I have seen how information, support, and belief in yourself, your baby, and birth can transform women, families, and lives forever.\"\n\n\u201cFor me an empowered birth is one where I am the one who makes the decisions for me and my baby. Where I am in an environment of love, support, and respect for the power within my body to successfully birth my baby. Where I can be free to express anything I need to express; sound, movement, fear, love, ecstasy in a place that my expression will not lead to interference from the outside. I believe women have the ability to create an empowering birth experience regardless of if the birth outcome is natural, medicated, or surgical. When women are making the decisions for their bodies and their babies out of education, faith, belief and confidence in themselves and not out of fear or manipulation they will be empowered. I believe in the human body, in it\u2019s power, and in birth\u2019s ability to transform a person, woman, wife, and mother.\u201d \n\nFor more info see: \nhttp://yourbirthcoach.com\nhttp://naturalbirthbabyandbeyond.com\nhttp://facebook.com/yourbirthcoachdrnancy\n\n\nor contact Nancy via:\ninfo@yourbirthcoach.com\n613-823-1255\n\nTopics previously discussed:\n'Positive Birth Is...'\n'Prenatal Testing'\n'Oxytocin'\n'Improving Birth'\n 'Risk'\n 'Fear'\n 'The Hour After Birth'\n 'Choices in Birth'\n 'Birth Place'\n 'Language of Birth'\n'Images of Birth'",

Recent information has updated the number to 276 girls missing. \n\nNigerians all over the world have rallied to help raise awareness of this issue and to also criticize the minimal efforts the Nigerian government has been making to help find the girls and stop the violence in Nigeria.\n\nThe Nigerian community in Ottawa has decided to play our part with one of these rallies. We will be having a march of solidarity for the girls and for other issues going on in the country on Sunday May 4th, 2014 at 6 pm. \n\nThe Rally/March will kick off at the Nigerian Embassy in Ottawa (295 Metcalfe St, Ottawa) and we will march down to the human rights monument which is opposite City Hall (110 Laurier Ave W, Ottawa). \nThere, we will light our candles and say a prayer for the girls and for the country as a whole. After that, we will march down to Rideau Center and those who wish can pass out flyers and inform the public about the missing girls.(Anyone can take part in handing out flyers, no one is obligated to do it)\n\nPlease come out and support. Help spread the word and create awareness. It could be anyone of us. Let our voices be heard. \nMay God bless you as you take part.\n\nWEAR RED and those who are able should wear a head tie. #BringBackOurGirls #BringBackOurGirlsCanada #Ottawa #BringBackOurGirlsAlive\n\nThank you and see you Sunday!",

Within the context of this graduating class, the exhibition acts as an introduction to the work of 40 emerging artists, and the beginning of their artistic careers.\n \nConsisting of work created by so many different artists, the exhibition inherently reflects the diversity present within the group, comprised of works within the fields of drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, multimedia, installation, and performance. Each artist presents work created within the final year in the program, the refined result of four years of growth and development, exploration and experimentation.\n \nExhibition Dates/Hours: Tuesday, April 22nd to Saturday, April 26th, 8 a.m. \u2013 6 p.m.\n\nVernissage: Friday, April 25th, 2014, 7-10 p.m.\n\n\u201cMeet-the-Artist\u201d Open House: Tuesday, April 22nd, 3 \u2013 7 p.m.",

We'll facilitate a short brainstorming session and have tons of creative ways for people to get their voices out there. If you're more crafty than chatty (or vice versa), we got you covered!  And of course, we'll have some snacks, too.\n\nCome for the snacks, stay for the revolution! \n\nThe official goal of this event is to bring together our allies to develop concrete messaging around gender-based violence for 2014 municipal candidates. We're going to aggregate the messages from the event onto our website where we'll have a little hub that basically boils down to: \"You want my vote? This is what I expect of you!\" \n\nOur unofficial goal is to bring together like-minded folks in a chill, welcoming space to talk about the reality of street harassment and what we, as a community, want to see done about it. \n\nLet's make gender-based violence a priority in this city!\n\nWant more info? ottawa@ihollaback.org\n\nNOTE: \nThe space is accessible.\n\nThis is a SAFE space. If you don't think gender-based violence is a 'thing' or you're a giant jerk, stay home.\n\nThis is an event designed for community members. If you're a candidate, GREAT that you want to know what people are thinking! BUT! We'll be aggregating all the feedback  for folks like you to check out at a later date. So, we ask that you stay home, too and allow residents a safe space to chat among themselves.",

This includes a system called the Work Capability Assessment that has been used to deny benefits to thousands of people. Disabled People Against Cuts (DPAC) is an organization in the UK that has been at the forefront of challenging this situation. It has mobilized disabled people to fight back and formed alliances with community organizations and unions in resisting the austerity measures of the Cameron Government. The hated private company, Atos, that was carrying out the assessments of sick and disabled people has been forced to quit as a result of the powerful resistance DPAC and others have taken up.\n\nHere in Ontario, we also face major attacks. Ontario Works (Welfare) and ODSP (Disability) rates are too low to enable people to pay their rent and eat properly. The Special Diet and Community Start Up have been slashed by the Ontario Liberal government. Under huge pressure from ongoing community action, the Liberals have promised not to merge OW and ODSP but the danger remains that they will bring in a UK style assessment system that would pose a huge threat to disabled people on ODSP. We need to understand what is happening elsewhere and how people are fighting back and winning against the attacks. Austerity is global \u2013 but so is our resistance.\n\nFrom May 4-15th, Ellen Clifford from DPAC will be visiting Toronto, Kitchener, Sudbury, Kingston and Ottawa. She has been campaigning with the disabled people\u2019s movement for 15 years and, since 2011, has sat on the National Steering Committee of DPAC. She is also a member of Unite the Union and works to build solidarity between workers in unions and those forced to live on social benefits.\n\n----------\nJoin the Raise the Rates Campaign Today!\nRaise the Rates is a campaign to fight poverty by raising social assistance rates in Ontario. Jointly organized by the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty (OCAP), the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Ontario, Sudbury Coalition Against Poverty (S-CAP), Kingston Coalition Against Poverty (K-CAP), Poverty Makes Us Sick Waterloo Region, Poverty Makes Us Sick Ottawa, OPSEU and other grassroots anti-poverty organizers and trade union allies from across Ontario. We are a growing movement united in fighting for:\n\n\u2022 Raise Social Assistance Rates 55%: reverse the cuts, raise the rates!\n\u2022 Restore Special Diet and Community Start-Up Benefits\n\u2022 Stop the Attack on Disability Benefits\n\u2022 Living wage for all: Raise the Minimum wage above poverty wages",

There is nothing timid about Laura Cortese (cor-TAY-zee). She wields a fiddle like a rocker slings his guitar, and sings with even more swagger. A native San Franciscan, Cortese moved to Boston to study violin at Berklee College of Music and has since immersed herself in the city's vibrant folk music scene. She has made appearances with Band of Horses, Pete Seeger, Patterson Hood and Michael Franti, and Jocie Adams of the Low Anthem. Laura tours internationally with Mariel Vandersteel.\n\nMariel Vandersteel grew up in the redwoods of California playing for local contra dances, at Irish sessions and spending summers at fiddle camp. Her love and curiosity for other musical cultures led her to study music nationally as well as in Ireland and at a hardanger fiddle school in Norway. A graduate of Berklee College of Music, Mariel has participated in the Savannah Music Festival's Acoustic Music Seminar studying under musicians including Mike Marshall, Edgar Meyer, Chris Thile and Zakir Hussein.\n \nwww.lauracortese.net\n \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-upN4K2lJY \u2013 pretty much what you\u2019re going to hear\n \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrsxQkwsujU \u2013 again, a great representation of these gals\n \nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SME4HO0dP8I \u2013 official video\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nFeatured local visual artist: Bradley Cayford\n\nBradley is a Classical Animator and artist that has worked ffor the past fourteen years in animation as a director, designer and storyboard artist on several tv shows as well as some music videos that have been nominated for several awards over the years. \n\nThis current expression of art directly connects with his experiences in nature and being in both the philosophical and physical nature of life.

        "description": "Blues Hall of Fame Inductee and Living Legend Lazy Lester comes back to Canada for 3 dates only and Ottawa is one of them. Lazy Lester, one of the original bluesmen, still active. Back in 1956, halfway between Louisiana\u2019s blues capital, Baton Rouge and Lake Charles, in a small studio outside of Crowley, La., producer Jay Miller created a unique, legendary sound for EXCELLO records, swamp blues. It would emerge from the bayous, the rice fields, and the stable of blues talent Miller had assembled. They created some of the most memorable American music ever recorded.  Lazy Lester was at its heart. Slim Harpo, Raful Neal, Lightin`Slim, Lonesome Sundown, Katie Webster and Leslie Johnston, better known by the nickname Miller gave him, Lazy Lester. He was the mainstay of the EXCELLO sound as he played all the instruments and sat in everywhere, the man who could back anything. Songs from the studio included Harpo`s \u201cKing Bee\u201d, \u201cRainin\u2019 in my Heart\u201d, \u201cBaby Scratch My Back\u201d, Hogan\u2019s \u201cEverybody Needs Somebody\u201d, Arthur Gunter\u2019s \u201cBaby Lets Play House\u201d, Slim\u2019s, \u201cBad Luck Blues\u201d-\u201cif it wasn\u2019t for bad luck, I wouldn\u2019t have no luck at all\u201d, his, \u201cCrazy \u2018Bout You Baby\u201d, \u201cThe Things I Used to Do\u201d. Besides playing on some of the above, to this mix Lester added his own swamp blues classics, like: \u201cI\u2019m a Lover Not a Fighter\u201d   \u201cI hear You Knockin\" \u201cSugar Coated Love\u201d  and  \u201cI Done Got Over it\u201d.\n\nMost of these performers are gone but there is Lester, 55 years later and he still has his chops. He is carrying on a tradition for lots of people who have passed. Lester, now 81, still performs with gusto and precision. His nasal pitched voice, imitated by his harp and his tight playing and arrangements still give the music a homemade feel. His biggest influences are two of the greatest bluesmen, Jimmy Reed and Little Walter, one on his vocals and the other, his harp playing. Lester mixes this sound with dashes of the country music he grew up with all around him, the real kind, traditional Cajun or Jimmie Rodgers influenced country. \u201cThe music has a lazy, loping feel, rhythmic edge, bathed in simmering, pulsating tape echo\u201d says AllMusic. Lester, fed up with the music business, dropped out of it for twenty years. After his break he emerged and fashioned a long acclaimed revival.  Lester was a W.C. Handy Award winner in 1987 for \u201cLazy Lester Rides Again\u201d recorded in England. He followed in the U.S., with his 1988 album, \u201cHarp & Soul\u201d, music with a sound redolent of all those Louisiana Swamp Blues Classics but with an updated edge that works well. He is a member of The BLUES HALL OF FAME in Memphis.  His song \u201cPondarosa Stomp\u201d gave its name to the roots festival that runs during the N.O. Jazz and Heritage Festival, The Ponderosa Stomp.  This is a chance to see one of the great pioneers of the blues, take it.\n\nLazy Lester will be backed by:\nBharath Rajakumar \nKeith Hallett\nPeter Rioux \nBuck Tingley \nBill Brennan",

Apr\u00e8s Satie: Four Two and Four Hands is a poetry collection inspired by Erik Satie's piano compositions.  Moody, often surreal in tone and content, the interplay of primo and secondo voices in these poems raises our awareness of the temporal nature of all things.\n\nAMANDA EARL is the managing editor of Bywords.ca and the publisher of AngelHousePress, including its transgressive prose imprint, DevilHouse. She is the author of several chapbooks. Her first poetry book will be published by Chaudiere Books in the fall of 2014. Her poems have also appeared in literary journals both on line and in print in Australia, Canada, England, France, Ireland and the USA. Amanda has received funding from the City of Ottawa and the Ontario Arts Council. \n\nDEAN STEADMAN\u2019s work has been published in Canadian journals and e-zines, as well as in the anthology Pith and Wry: Canadian Poetry (Scrivener Press, 2010).  His poem, \u201cCrime Passionnel\u201d (Descant 144, Spring 2009), was selected by Lorna Crozier as one of the top 100 poems in The Best Canadian Poetry in English, 2010 (Tightrope Books).

We complain about him or her, this or that, and convince ourselves that if things outside of ourselves would change, our experience of life would change. But our internal landscape determines our experience of the external one. Perception is not a window, it is a mirror.\n\nThis is a workshop about the spiritual dilemma that underlies and translates into the psychological drama of our daily lives. You will be presented with an internal map, based on A Course in Miracles, of the dynamics of the psychological defense system that is revolutionary and universal in application. This can be a life altering moment, delivered at the level of experience rather than restricted to intellect and insight.\n\nThe Awakening is a creative, empowering, process oriented weekend, focusing in depth on the relinquishment of a thought system based on fear for a thought system based on love.",
