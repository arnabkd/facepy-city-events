        "description": "On November 4, 2008 Proposition 8 passed in California, amending the state Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. The defeat provoked a groundswell of initiative within the GLBT community at a grassroots level, with many new political and protest organizations being formed in response. \n\nThe NOH8 Campaign is a photographic silent protest created by celebrity photographer Adam Bouska (http://www.bouska.net) and partner Jeff Parshley in direct response to the passage of Proposition 8. Photos feature subjects with duct tape over their mouths, symbolizing their voices being silenced by Prop 8 and similar legislation around the world, with \"NOH8\" painted on one cheek in protest.\n\n\nFive years since its inception, the NOH8 Campaign has grown to nearly 33,000 faces and continues to grow at an exponential rate. The campaign began with portraits of everyday Californians from all walks of life and soon rose to include politicians, military personnel, newlyweds, law enforcement, artists, celebrities, and many more. \n\nThe NOH8 Campaign has received overwhelming support from around the world, and has appeared in various local and national news programs and publications. The images are widely used on various social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter to spread the message of equality.\n\nTO PARTCIPATE, \"like\" and \"share\" this event. Once we have enough people we will confirm with Adam Bouska and tell him how proud we are in the Nations Capital to help on this awesome campaign.\n\nThank you all for your support",

Through visuals, words, sounds, and original music, \u201cGender Failure\u201d explores and exposes the prolific pair\u2019s failed attempts at fitting into the gender binary\u2014and ultimately how the gender binary doesn\u2019t add up. Coyote brings their razor-sharp timing and powerful narrative, while Spoon adds an ethereal voice and poetic turns of phrase to the dynamic duo\u2019s now seven-year-old artistic partnership.\n\nThis is also the official Ottawa launch of their book \"Gender Failure,\" a poignant collection of autobiographical essays, lyrics, and images documenting Ivan and Rae's personal journeys from gender failure to gender self-acceptance. Equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking, it's a book that will touch LGBTQ readers and others, revealing, with candor and insight, that gender comes in more than two sizes. Gender Failure is co-written by Rae and Ivan and published by Arsenal Pulp Press:\n\nhttp://www.arsenalpulp.com/bookinfo.php?index=398\n\nPlease join us in welcoming these amazing artists on April 25th at Knox Presbyterian Church, 120 Lisgar Street (at Elgin).

The three women, Dr. Hawa Abdi, Dr. Edna Adan, and Ilwad Elman, are icons of strength and resiliency. \n\nFunds raised from the screening will go directly towards supporting the Pediatric Department at the Dr. Hawa Abdi General Hospital in Somalia. Additional donations are welcomed at the event. \n\nAdmission: Adult $15; Students $10\n\nMayfair Theatre\n1074 Bank Street, Ottawa, ON\n(613) 730-3403\n\nOr \n\nHCI Office: 613-742-5948\nWashim: 613-866-3836\n\nClick on the link below for early reservation: \nhttps://humanconcern.org/through-the-fire-ottawa\n\nFilm trailer: http://www.throughthefire.co.uk/portfolio/trailers/",

Find out how you can get involved in the movement to stop Energy East.\n\nFREE ADMISSION! FIRST COME FIRST SERVE!\n\nDOORS OPEN AT 6:30, event 7:00-8:30pm  \n\nBackground information: \n\nTransCanada\u2019s Energy East pipeline project would convert a 40 year-old natural gas pipeline from Saskatchewan to Ontario, connecting it with new pipeline through Quebec and on to Saint John, New Brunswick. Transporting 1.1 million barrels of oil every day, it would be the largest oil pipeline in North America.\n\nThis tour is taking place at the same time as Ontario Energy Board consultations on the pipeline. These consultations are an important platform to have our voices heard, and encourage our provincial government to stand up for Ontarians against this broken pipeline plan.\n\nFor background information and to read more, please visit http://canadians.org/energyeast-tour",

I'm not out of the woods yet, but everyday will be a positive, up hill battle.  \n\nI was in the hospital for 11 days and received the best care I could have wished for at the Ottawa Civic Hospital. The staff was professional, kind and possessed expertise like no other! \n\nDuring my time there,  I was in the Acute Neurological Intensive Care unit and was lucky enough to be given one of the \"Cadillac\" beds. Those beds are very limited in the ward and not every patient gets to have one...but they do help provide the appropriate care needed for people in need recovering from cancers, strokes, and more.\n\nI want to pay the Ottawa Civic Hospital back for the terrific care I've received.\n\nWhen they gave my bed to someone that was more in need (and assigned me to a normal bed), I realized that every patient that was placed into that ward shouldn't be sleeping on the normal beds that are extremely uncomfortable but one of those \"Cadillac\" beds.\n\nI hope that the proceeds raised can go towards the purchase of another \"Cadillac\" bed for the ward.\"\n\n\nEvent will be comprised of:\n\nSilent auction\nStarts:: March 30 9 A.M \nCloses: April 6th noon\n\nHandle with Care wrestling exhibition brought to you by the stars Mecca Pro Wrestling.\n\n\nLive Entertainment  featuring some of Eastern Ontario's top talent such as RMJ and The FreakBoy, Right on Band from Ottawa.\n\nFace painting and family fun games \n\n50/50 draw.\n\nThe event will have a BBQ and baked goods will also be sold.\n\n100% of the profits goes to the Ottawa Hospital Neurology Department!\n\nThanks everyone!

My team, GeeGees Quidditch, won Canadian Cup this year and will be going to the World Cup in South Carolina to represent our school and Canada - we are one of only 4 Canadian teams going. One of those other 4 teams is our sister team, Maple Rush Quidditch. They also represent uOttawa, and we're all super excited for the chance to have 2 of the top 4 Canadian teams representing our school.\n\nIn order to get to World Cup though, we're doing a lot of fundraising. We have 42 international-level athletes plus 2 coaches all trying to get there, and as students we don't have a whole lot of our own money! We're all going to be paying for our own flights and are hoping to fundraise enough to cover hotels and transportation on the ground in Myrtle Beach. \n\nThis group of people is my family here in Ottawa. We have Thanksgiving and Easter dinners, study parties during exams, and help each other out with life when we need it. I would personally really appreciate it if you can donate anything - even $1 or $2 would help! Every athlete we're taking puts in hours of work every week and we're hoping that this year we can be the first non-US team to make the Sweet 16 (last year we were the first non-US team to make bracket play, so this year we want to make it further!). \n\nWe have some pretty fantastic thank-you gifts if you donate. There's everything from a twitter shout-out to a postcard from Myrtle Beach to a custom tote-bag, hand-made by yours truly! Every little bit helps. Even if you can't donate, I'd really appreciate if you could pass this link on to your friends and anyone you know of who might support a group of Canadian quidditch players! \n\nIndiegogo link can be found here: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/uottawa-quidditch-goes-to-world-cup\n\nThank you in advance for any donations or passing-on of the link! If you donate, let me know, because I want to be able to send you a thank-you note :)",

The same year the band released the album \u201cStigmata High-Five\u201d and toured extensively, only to take a break from the road to record their sophomore release \u201cDisgorge Mexico\u201d in 2008.\n\nFollowing the release of \u201cDisgorge Mexico\u201d, Fuck The Facts took a step back to the band\u2019s more DIY roots with a number of independent releases.  A 3rd full length for Relapse Records, \u201cDie Miserable\u201d, was released in 2011 and nominated for a Juno in the Best Metal/Hard Rock Album category.  \n\nNow with the acclaimed newest release \u201cAmer\u201d, which was produced entirely at the band\u2019s own studio (Apartment 2) and self-released, Fuck The Facts continues to grow not only musically, but also with DIY independence, showing that there really is no end in sight. \n\n\nRITUAL DICTATES ( Vancouver, BC )\nhttps://facebook.com/ritualdictates\n\nInspired by a wide array of styles and instruments, the music itself has straightforward elements of metal and grind, with detours into anything from half time black metal to good time rock and roll.\n\nPicking up on inspiration from their respective previous bands Allfather and Angel Grinder, Justin and Ash are continuing down the heavy metal path while fusing their eclectic influences of classic rock and roll, punk, black metal and grind into interesting new places.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nFor Party/Guestlist service inquiries please contact:\nguestlist@electricowl.ca\n\nLike our Page! => https://www.facebook.com/ElectricOwlSocialClub\n\nInterested in joining our Street Team?

You are now one of the few remaining survivors, will you run, or will you hide? Will you remain loyal to your group? You have one immunity injection left, will you end your team-mates life and extend \nthe duration of your own? Or will sacrifice your own life to let your team-mates live?

At the end of the round, the zombie with the most flags will be awarded a prize.\n\nSurvivors: Your goal is to hide out from the Zombie's for two and a half hours. You will be given (A) flag upon your entry into the game this is your ''immunity''. If this is removed from your waist, you have lost and must make your way back to base. AKA out of the forest - once there tell one of the organizers (in the plain white shirts that you've been caught.)  There is no Dress Code.

It was originally the World Wide March Against Corruption combined with the Omnibus March Against Harper in Canada.  The goal of waking up the masses through protest is education of the corruption going on in Canada and around the world. Although this is happening in many locations in Canada we would like as many Canadians that can make the trip to Ottawa for this protest as possible to come.\n\nThroughout the event there will be all ministers, military officials, diplomats, and special guests arriving in Ottawa. We have a permit for a peaceful protest and welcome all groups, families and individuals to join us. \n\nDuring the day from 7am until 9pm we will be protesting on Parliament Hill with marches every 2 hours one group from Parliament hill to the human rights monument on Lisgar and Elgin. Also a second group Marching from Parliament Hill to 58 George street in the Byward Market. Of course back to Parliament Hill again. \n\nAt 9pm each night we will be on the Wellington street side of the gate. On the sidewalks until 7am each morning. Then we will move back to the Parliament Hill Side. During the evening on the Wellington street side we will be protesting and sleeping/sitting in chairs or standing. We will leave enough room for pedestrians to be able to also use the sidewalk. I have spoken with the Ottawa police as we have discussed and informed them of all this.  We have been peaceful, polite and cleaned up our mess. This time will be no different.\n\nOn May 4, 2014 ; we are aware there is another event taking place on Parliament Hill. For this day we have reserved the North West side of Wellington street and Metcalfe for our protest. That would be from approx 7am until 3pm. It is right where all the ministers, military, diplomats and guest speakers will be hosting their event. The will see and hear everything we are doing.\n\nOur group is more than happy to work with all people, groups and organizations who want to stop government corruption to make this a constructive, peaceful protest. Please contact the Admins if you have any questions.\nAlso, please join the Canada event page : \nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1473029886258968/\nYou can find the list of locations in Canada on the top post of the Canada page. \nPlease note the description for the march is different on the Canada page, which is mainly focused on  taking down Harper and stopping the pipeline....for the world. \nWe are all in this together. \n\n***************************************************************\n\nOnce again let us unite all groups for this event. Every one is welcome. Everyone is welcome. All groups and organizations.\n\nTHIS TIME IT IS A 4 DAY EVENT TO REALLY WAKE UP THE MASSES. NOT EVERYONE CAN BE THERE ALL FOUR DAYS BUT PLEASE COME OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DURING THE 4 DAY EVENT!\n\n\nPeace and respect to everyone.\n\n****************************************************************\n\nPlease meet at Parliament Hill near the flame at noon. Please dress the weather. Please bring water to drink and signs to display. We will protest on the hill. We will be contacting media to let them know we will be there protesting against our government for their corruption. Bring Cameras if you wish and this will be peaceful but it is a good thing to have a buddy system. I also ask that people bring a garbage bag or two. We would like to keep the area clean. This is our planet we don't want to mess it up ;)\n\n****************************************************************\nTHANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO MARCHED ON MARCH 1, 2014 FOR THE WORLD WIDE MARCH AGAINST GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION. WE ARE SO PROUD OF ALL OF YOU! \nPlease see the Canada Slideshow on the Canada page as well as the World Wide slideshow and video accessible on the World Wide main event page.",

I have had three incredibly wonderful natural home birth experiences in 2006, 2009, and 2011. I have supported many women through pregnancy and birth. I have seen how information, support, and belief in yourself, your baby, and birth can transform women, families, and lives forever.\"\n\n\u201cFor me an empowered birth is one where I am the one who makes the decisions for me and my baby. Where I am in an environment of love, support, and respect for the power within my body to successfully birth my baby. Where I can be free to express anything I need to express; sound, movement, fear, love, ecstasy in a place that my expression will not lead to interference from the outside. I believe women have the ability to create an empowering birth experience regardless of if the birth outcome is natural, medicated, or surgical. When women are making the decisions for their bodies and their babies out of education, faith, belief and confidence in themselves and not out of fear or manipulation they will be empowered. I believe in the human body, in it\u2019s power, and in birth\u2019s ability to transform a person, woman, wife, and mother.\u201d \n\nFor more info see: \nhttp://yourbirthcoach.com\nhttp://naturalbirthbabyandbeyond.com\nhttp://facebook.com/yourbirthcoachdrnancy\n\n\nor contact Nancy via:\ninfo@yourbirthcoach.com\n613-823-1255\n\nTopics previously discussed:\n'Positive Birth Is...'\n'Prenatal Testing'\n'Oxytocin'\n'Improving Birth'\n 'Risk'\n 'Fear'\n 'The Hour After Birth'\n 'Choices in Birth'\n 'Birth Place'\n 'Language of Birth'\n'Images of Birth'",

This was a feast for the followers; faithful renditions for the many die hard starship troopers that were no doubt reliving many scrapbook Yes memories over the years. But the show was not about mere nostalgia. This is a band that still feels strangely new, simply by doing what they do, pushing the boundaries and presenting songs that, like the wildly colorful and original Roger Dean artwork that represents them, are just beautifully designed and built to last.\u201d\n\nSPECIAL PACKAGES\nYES is proud to provide special show packages, which include near-stage seating, a Meet and Greet with the band, exclusive limited-edition gifts from YES, and much more.\n\nYes - Meet & Greet Package\nPackage includes:\nOne reserved ticket located in the first 5 rows of the stage\nExclusive autograph session with Yes\nPersonal photograph with Yes\nSpecially designed tour shirt (limited to VIP packages only)\nCollectible tour poster (numbered, limited)\nRemastered, super audio CD copy of \"Close to the Edge\"\nSet of official Yes guitar picks (with case)\nOfficial meet & greet laminate\nOn-site VIP host\nLimited availability\n\nYes - VIP Tour Package\nPackage includes:\nOne reserved ticket located in the first 15 rows of the stage\nSpecially designed tour shirt (limited to VIP packages only)\nCollectible tour poster (numbered, limited)\nRemastered, super audio CD copy of \"Close to the Edge\"\nSet of official Yes guitar picks (with case)\nCommemorative VIP laminate\nLimited availability\n\nTIMES\nAll Shows are Three Album Shows with Doors at 6:30pm, Show at 7:30pm.

Essentially a small group of us have been getting together since November to meet up a few times a month and just praise God, wherever we could meet up. We wanted to find an authentic heart of worship. To lay aside egos, big set ups, distractions- anything not of God- and find the joy of praise in simplicity. As interest grew, we needed bigger spaces (Thanks St. Philip's!).\n\nAll you need is to bring yourself and a willing heart. If you play an instrument, bring it out!!!!!

Leurs pr\u00e9sences et encouragements m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019une grande source de motivation et d\u2019\u00e9nergie incroyable. Ce fut aussi plus plaisant pour eux car ils n\u2019ont pas pass\u00e9 1h44 \u00e0 m\u2019attendre a l\u2019arriv\u00e9e :) Et gr\u00e2ce a eux, j\u2019ai des souvenirs de l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement  qui ne sont normalement pas captur\u00e9s https://www.facebook.com/remi.bachand/media_set?set=a.10152849183965006.1073741827.857865005&type=3\n\nPLUS GROS DEFI A DATE\nCette ann\u00e9e, je me suis inscris a mon plus grand d\u00e9fi a date. C\u2019est le 40e marathon d\u2019Ottawa, c\u2019est plus de 40km et c\u2019est a l\u2019aube de mes 40 ans (jvous es tu dis?\u2026). En partant, je suis chanceux car nous sommes plusieurs a faire le marathon incluant Magalie qui va rester avec moi durant toute la distance. HEIN MAG!!!??\n\nNOUS AVONS BESOINS DE VOUS!\nAlors pour ma f\u00eate et pour ce d\u00e9fi, je vous invite \u00e0 venir nous encourager tout au long du trajet et ensuite de venir diner avec nous (resto a d\u00e9terminer).\n\nPOINT DE RENCONTRE AU D\u00c9PART ET A L\u2019ARRIV\u00c9E\nLa tradition continue avec le point de rencontre au parc de la conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration (Statue avec un aigle)\n\nhttps://www.google.com/maps/place/Elgin+Cafe/@45.421547,-75.693442,3a,75y,73.5h,90t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sr9Dre1vFY0h_h_jcE8GvZA!2e0!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x7dbc0b2ddf4ba35d!6m1!1e1\n\nen face de l\u2019h\u00f4tel Lord Elgin. Une fois la ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e franchise, nous allons de peine et mis\u00e8re, se rendre a ce m\u00eame point :)\n\nCOMMENT NOUS SUIVRE\nNous allons \u00e9tablir des estimations de nos temps pour les distances suivantes\n\n10e km (Wellington et Clarendon)\n20e km (Laurier et Eddy)\n35e (St-Patrick et Vanier)\n42e (ligne d\u2019arriv\u00e9e)\n\nCes estim\u00e9s vous permettront de calculer vos d\u00e9placements :) Si certains d\u2019entres vous ne peuvent \u00eatre au d\u00e9part a 7:00 AM, vous pouvez vous levez un peu plus tard et vous rendre en avance a ces points. Nous allons essayer de toujours rester du cot\u00e9 droite de la route (chiffres pair)\nDe plus, je vais utiliser le syst\u00e8me de rep\u00e9rage en direct qui vous permettra de nous suivre end direct. \nhttp://www.racemyrace.com/hosted/ottawa_full.php\n\nVous allez devoir choisir la course (Events & Races) et ensuite clicker sur Live Tracking et Add Racer et de la vous pouvez m\u2019ajouter par plusieurs crit\u00e8res",

The film will be followed by a discussion of the situation in Colombia and the human rights concerns of Amnesty International. The event is free so spread the word! :)\n\nDrinks, popcorn and desserts will also be available. All donations will go towards AI's work on behalf of the Peace Community of San Jos\u00e9 de Apartad\u00f3. There is free parking behind the AI Canada Office building off Russell Avenue.\n\nAbout the documentary Hope for Colombia:\n\nHope for Colombia follows the 10 day Grace Pilgrimage through and around the Colombian capital Bogota in November 2010. It is a portrait of two projects \u2013 Tamera, a peace research centre in Portugal which organized the pilgrimage, and the Colombian peace community San Jos\u00e9 de Apartad\u00f3.\n\nThe film shows the coming together of the two communities, their encounters with other peace activists and groups in the city of Bogota, shanty towns and remote areas, and with government officials to create a network of protection for the peace community in Colombia and to show a possible path toward a global culture of peace in a seemingly hopeless situation.\n\n\"For the blindness of those who are murderers makes them unable to see that they can do what they want, there will always be community as long as pain turns into hope.\"\n\u2014Eduar Lanchero, peace community San Jos\u00e9 de Apartad\u00f3",

A night to strut your stuff. \n\nThere IS a dress code. Suits... ties and jackets. Dresses. I don't care what gender you are underneath your clothing but please DO dress up for it. Feel fancy. Get your gorgeous on. Will I turn you away if you show up in jeans and tshirt? Newp... I shan't... but I will adore you all the more if you dress for the occasion.\n\nThis is an evening event so no 'family afternoon hour' unfortunately, which means if you gots kids you'll need to arrange a babysitter. \n\nBring your own alcohol. Munchies will occur. Music will be provided. Interesting and intriguing people will be in attendance.\n\nNote: there will be a smoking room in the back for those what smoke tobacco. Please, only tobacco. There are no pets for those with allergies.\n\nFor those what have not been here before, it's Apartment 4. No buzz code, just press the button marked '4' at the front door.

Despite several democratic setbacks, as well as an escalated climate of violence and repression in Honduras, the Canadian government has only deepened its political support for, as well as economic ties with the Central American country. A trade deal between Canada and Honduras, signed in November 2013 and currently being pushed through parliament, risks exacerbating an already dire situation, putting investor rights head of community rights.\n\nHosted by the Americas Policy Group (Canadian Council for International Cooperation), PSAC Social Justice Fund and Canadian Union of Public Employees.\n\nThis is part of the Building Solidarity with Honduras Tour: Peoples' Rights over Corporate Rights.

        "description": "Join us for the launch of Min Fami: Arab Feminist Reflections on Identity, Space, and Resistance (Inanna Publications), an exciting new anthology edited by Ghadeer Malek and Ghaida Moussa, featuring over 30 contributor's poetry, short stories, critical reflections, academic work, and visual art by Arab feminists from across the world.\n\nWe are coming to Ottawa to celebrate the release of the book after 3 years of heart, soul, longing, (and lots of long nights!). \n\nAlong with selected readings from the book, the evening will include special guest performances by Myron and Sibylle Rym Ben Berrah, and Maha Zimmo! No Arab celebration would be complete without good food and good conversation!\n\nThis event is free, and all are welcome!\n\nAccessibility Note:\n\nVenus Envy is wheelchair accessible.\nSeating is limited but there will be standing room, and some floor seating, but let us know if you need a seat reserved.\nIf there are any ways we can make this event more accessible to you, please let us know as soon as you can by calling 613 789 4646.\n\nMore about the book:\n\nMin Fami: Arab Feminist Reflections on Identity, Space, and Resistance is an anthology that cradles the thoughts of Arab feminists, articulated through personal critical narratives, academic essays, poetry, short stories, and visual art. It is a meeting space where discussions on home(land), exile, feminism, borders, gender and sexual identity, solidarity, language, creative resistance, and (de)colonization are shared, confronted, and subverted. In a world that has increasingly found monolithic and one-dimensional ways of representing Arab womyn, this anthology comes as an alternate space in which we connect on the basis of our shared identities, despite physical, theoretical, and metaphorical distances, to celebrate our multiple voices, honour our ancestry, and build community on our own terms, and in our own voices. Pre-order is now available online: https://www.inanna.ca/index.php/catalog/min-fami-arab-feminist-reflections-identity-space-and-resistance/\n\nAbout the editors:\n\nGhadeer Malek is a Palestinian feminist activist, aspiring writer and spoken word poet. She immigrated to Toronto in 2003 to study at the University of Toronto and graduated with an honours bachelor degree in History and Middle Eastern studies after which she joined the Association of Women\u2019s Right in Development (AWID). She currently coordinates the Young Feminist Activism (YFA) Program at AWID and is pursuing a Master\u2019s degree at OISE/UT. Ghadeer is also a co-founder and editor of Aqsazine, an art collective of young progressive and critical Muslim women passionate about combating gender-based violence through art. Ghadeer\u2019s poetry has been published in Feminism for real and Shameless Magazine. \n\nGhaida Moussa is a scholar, educator, and dj, who is passionately drawn to creative articulations of resistance, identity, memory, and space. She holds a bi-disciplinary Master\u2019s degree in International Development and Global Studies, and Women\u2019s Studies from the University of Ottawa. She is currently undertaking her Ph.D. in Social and Political Thought at York University in Toronto, Canada. The past couple of years, she has been devoted to translating anti-colonial notions onto dance floors, thinking through \u201chome\u201d in the cracks between anchored locations and collective memory, and practicing pedagogy from the heart in the classroom and in alternate spaces of education.\n\n\nAbout the performers:\n\nRym Ben Berrah, Sibylle de surnom, est une \u00e9tudiante en autisme et en psychologie. Originaire de l'Afrique du Nord, Tuniso-Alg\u00e9rienne, elle est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al durant son adolescence et partage le reste de sa vie entre Ottawa, Montr\u00e9al et nouvellement Toronto. R\u00e9cipiendaire de nombreux prix d'\u00e9criture de nouvelles, de slam et de th\u00e9\u00e2tre, elle se sp\u00e9cialise dans l'art de la sc\u00e8ne depuis 2008. Ses inspirations sont diverses, mais le tout est sibyllin, rythm\u00e9 de douceur et de v\u00e9racit\u00e9.\n\nMaha Zimmo family came to Canada when she was aged four and still malleable to her parents' will. They are Muslim, Palestinian and she was born in Libya; essentially, her identity is where all Axis of Evil points converse. March 29th marks her ten year anniversary as writer at / owner of Prolific Immigrant (onefemalecanuck.com); she has completed Middle Eastern news analysis for several progressive news teams such as Rabble. She is currently the resident 'Know-It-All' advice columnist at both Elle Beaver - where Canadian feminists discuss issues and challenge one another, and everyone else - and at Chai Latte Diaries.",

Une amie qui habite \u00e0 Hull, m'a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir un \u00e9v\u00e9nement chez elle, soit \u00e9galement un endroit o\u00f9 il se d\u00e9roule r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des cours de m\u00e9ditation dans cette r\u00e9gion. Comme tous les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d'Alignement Alpha, l'ambiance sera d'avantage amicale que formelle. \n\nL'Alignement Alpha agit sur les niveaux physique, mental, \u00e9motionnel, spirituel, structurel, musculaire, vasculaire et chimique. Il se focalise sur la bonne relation entre le corps et l'esprit, et comment cette interrelation peut affecter nos fonctions vitales et notre performance humaine dans tous les domaines de notre vie. C'est un processus ...par lequel les blocages et les restrictions de la bonne circulation de l'\u00e9nergie vitale (Life Energy) sont temporairement retir\u00e9es, permettant ainsi \u00e0 l'\u00e9nergie de s'\u00e9couler plus librement dans toutes les parties du corps. En cons\u00e9quence, vous retrouvez le bien-\u00eatre, la bonne humeur et la joie de vivre que vous aviez du temps de votre enfance.\n\nLorsque vous \u00eates calmes, votre intelligence inn\u00e9e travaille pour vous en temps r\u00e9el, dans l'instant pr\u00e9sent, de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e et naturelle, d'une fa\u00e7on qui peut vous emp\u00eacher de vivre dans l'agitation excessive des pens\u00e9es, de r\u00e9agir de fa\u00e7on exag\u00e9r\u00e9es aux formes de stress subtiles, aux situations n\u00e9gatives de la vie et de se replier dans un monde isol\u00e9 parce que le cerveau est verrouill\u00e9. L'Alignement Alpha offre un moyen de r\u00e9soudre les difficult\u00e9s de votre vie et de r\u00e9aliser pleinement votre potentiel. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle le rythme alpha, qui sont des ondes plus douces et relaxantes.\n\nJ'invite mes ami(e)s \u00e0 d\u00e9couvrir l'Alignement Alpha. Vous aurez l'occasion d'exp\u00e9rimenter un \u00e9tat d'\u00eatre \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique nouveau gr\u00e2ce aux ondes alpha et la possibilit\u00e9 de vous sentir diff\u00e9rent, plus positif et plus heureux.\n\nVoici les commentaires des amis qui exp\u00e9rimentent r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement l'alignement alpha : http://www.alignementalpha.ca/#!les-commentaires-des-amis/cqaz\n\nUne pr\u00e9sentation d\u00e9taill\u00e9 de l'Alignement Alpha ici :\nhttp://www.alignementalpha.ca/#!Une-prsentation-dtaille-de-lAlignement-Alpha/cpz2/1\n_____________________________________________________\nD\u00e9tails de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement du 18 avril:\n\nPour les nouveaux \u00e0 l'Alignement Alpha, il y aura 2 opportunit\u00e9s de participer dans la m\u00eame journ\u00e9e (2 groupes): Une s\u00e9ance d'information obligatoire suivie d\u2019alignements aura lieu \u00e0 13:00 et une deuxi\u00e8me \u00e0 17H00. En confirmant votre pr\u00e9sence directement sur l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement, SVP publier une note qu'il s'agit de votre premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience ainsi que la s\u00e9ance de votre choix (13 :00 o\u00f9 17 :00), si vous \u00eates accompagn\u00e9s, SVP indiquer le nombre de personnes qui seront avec vous. La s\u00e9ance d\u2019introduction \u00e0 l\u2019Alignement Alpha (information, \u00e9valuation + 3 alignements) co\u00fbte $150.00, normalement l'introduction (premi\u00e8re s\u00e9ance) compte 2 alignements. Si vous d\u00e9sirez approfondir l'exp\u00e9rience, il sera possible de le faire, nous en discuterons sur place et \u00e9valuerons les possibilit\u00e9s. Les deux s\u00e9ances d'information sont \u00e9galement ouvertes aux personnes qui souhaitent uniquement en savoir d'avantage sur le stress, l'\u00e9nergie, l'\u00e9quilibre corps/esprit et comment fonctionne l'Alignement Alpha.\n\nPour les personnes d\u00e9j\u00e0 famili\u00e8res avec l'Alignement Alpha, je peux vous recevoir entre 15 :00 et 17 :00 (dernier d\u00e9but de RV), je vous prie de confirmer votre pr\u00e9sence directement sur l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement et de pr\u00e9ciser l'heure qui vous convient. Vous pouvez \u00e9galement m'envoyer un message priv\u00e9 ou me contacter au 418-951-4559 pour prendre RV. \u00c0 la base, je vous offre 3 alignements pour $100.00 plut\u00f4t que 2.

In 2012, he spend most of the year in pre-production for his next full-length album which he just finished recording at Break Glass Studios with producer and Besnard Lakes frontman, Jace Lasek (Land of Talk, Suuns).

The winner of the Ottawa Final will compete in the 2014 National Championship.\n\nCongratulations to Richard Morrissette, winner of February's Art Battle 99!  Here is the review of his win and the event in the Ottawa Citizen > http://www.ottawacitizen.com/mobile/news/ottawa/Battle+Ottawa/9540790/story.html\n\nTo paint with Art Battle in Ottawa or another city, please visit our application page at http://artbattle.ca/register\n\nOur promotional partners, the AOE Arts Council (AOE) have been serving the Ottawa arts community for 25 years. AOE represents a bilingual membership of over 450 artists, organizations and supporters. Visit www.artsoe.ca to learn more.\n\nWHAT IS ART BATTLE?\n\nArt Battle is live competitive painting. Painters create the best work they can in 20 minutes. As they work, patrons move around the easels, closely watching the creative process. The medium is acrylic paint and the tools allowed are brushes, palette knives or any non-mechanical implements. At the end of the round, the audience votes democratically for their favourite painting and bids in silent auction to take the work home. This is Art Battle Canada\u2019s 5th season and first full season in Ottawa.\n\nArt Battle 111\nSaturday, March 29th 7pm\nArts Court, 2 Daly Ave\nTickets 15$ door/10$ Limited Advance online\n$10 at the door for Students and Seniors",

To order in Canada, please visit: http://fernwoodpublishing.ca/Crises-of-Imagination-Crises-of-Power/ \n\nABOUT THE BOOK\n\nhttp://www.zedbooks.co.uk/paperback/crises-of-imagination-crises-of-power\n\n\"Today, when it seems like everything has been privatized, when austerity is too often seen as an economic or political problem that can be solved through better policy, and when the idea of moral values has been commandeered by the right, how can we re-imagine the forces used as weapons against community, solidarity, ecology and life itself?\n\nIn this stirring call to arms, Max Haiven argues that capitalism has colonized how we all imagine and express what is valuable. Looking at the decline of the public sphere, the corporatization of education, the privatization of creativity, and the power of finance capital in opposition to the power of the imagination and the growth of contemporary social movements, Haiven provides a powerful argument for creating an anti-capitalist commons. Capitalism is not in crisis, it is the crisis, and moving beyond it is the only key to survival.\n\nCrucial reading for all those questioning the imposition of austerity and hoping for a fairer future beyond it.\"\n\nFree and open to all\n\nMax Haiven is an assistant professor in the Division of Art History and Critical Studies at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax. His work has appeared in journals such as Social Text, Cultural Studies, and Mediations. He is the author of Cultures of Financialization (2014) and (with Alex Khasnabish) of The Radical Imagination (Zed Books, 2014).",

He cast himself as the ultimate insider, Parliament Hill\u2019s man in the know. It made him a household name and one of the Canada\u2019s best-paid journalists. \n\nBut Duffy wanted to get even closer and lobbied his way into the Canadian Senate, with dire results. Veteran journalist Dan Leger tells the story of Duffy\u2019s rise to the top in Canadian media, his entanglement with the Harper Conservatives, and the scandal that made him one of the most controversial figures in contemporary politics. \n\nIncludes a foreword by CBC\u2019s Peter Mansbridge and an eight-page colour photo insert. \n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR:\n\nDan Leger is one of Canada's most versatile journalists. After 12 years reporting for the Canadian Press in Halifax, St. John's, and on Parliament Hill, he moved to the CBC as a producer and executive producer. In 2005, he joined The Chronicle Herald as managing editor and columnist. He is a Gemini Award winner, and holds two Atlantic Journalism Awards for Commentary.",

The University of Ottawa is a signatory to this international agreement. We would sincerely appreciate your voice as a distinguished professional and expert in this industry.\n\nLocation:\n4101 (4th floor) Desmarais Building, (DMS) - University Of Ottawa - 55 Laurier East Ottawa, Ontario, K1N 6N5\n\nWe would like to thank the Graduate Student Association (GSAED), OPIRG (Ontario Public Interest Research Group Ottawa), the School of Management, the Political Studies Department and the Association des \u00e9tudiant(e)s dipl\u00f4m\u00e9(e)s en \u00e9tudes politiques.\n\n****\n\nSOCIAL FINANCE AND ETHICAL INVESTMENTS\nThe boundaries between public and private are blurring with the responsibilities of social development no longer in the hands of government. It is inappropriate for the private sector to safely hide behind Milton Friedman\u2019s assertion that \u201c\u2026 the only social responsibility of business is to increase its profits \u2026\u201d1 The students of University of Ottawa are interested in alternative investment options that take into account social and ethical considerations. In the last several decades social finance and ethical investment have become increasingly important and sought after investment methods. For example portfolios with social investment started as early as 1984, which according to the Social Investment Forum worth around 40 billion. A decade later this number grew to $639 billion, while in 2001 it was $2.3 trillion.2 Around the world funds have been organized in national settings like the Pay for Success, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation in the United States.\n\n\n1.Milton Friedman, Greed is Good, the Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits, NEW YORK TIMES, 13 September 1970\n2.Florini, A., 2003. \u2018Business and global governance: the growing role of corporate codes of conduct\u2019, Brookings Review 21 (3)\n\nETHICAL INVESTING AND SOCIAL FINANCE\nAmerica by the new Eduniversal 2013-2014 Masters ranking in the General Management category. The university has made breakthrough advancements in the fields of sciences, social sciences, and health on the global setting. The University`s proximity to Parliament and other national institutions gives it an important role in the formation of developing Canadian policy. Due to Ottawa`s meteoritic rise and commitments to justice there is demand for pursuing socially equitable and progressive Financial policies.\n\n\nFormat of Event\nProminent and distinguished experts will be invited to answer a number of questions moderated by Associate Professor Penelope Simons. Upon the conclusion of the questions, the audience will be encouraged to ask questions. The event will end with a fully catered networking event. \n\nFor more information, please contact Ana\u00efs Elboujda\u00efni, Student Member of the University of Ottawa, Board of Governors at anaiselboujdaini@gmail.com",

        "description": "Every year, the Student Refugee Program (SRP) welcomes one to two refugee students to the University of Ottawa, where their tuition is waived for two years, and their expenses are covered for the first year. This program is made possible with the support of the uOttawa administration and the World University Service of Canada (WUSC).  Most importantly, it is made possible by the $1.27 student levy every uOttawa student contributes each year to the SRP.\n\nNext year, we would like to generate enough support to raise the student levy, so that uOttawa can sponsor additional refugees to come and study, and so that we can become a leading Canadian university with a well recognized and respected Student Refugee Program.  This will not be possible without bringing more attention to the SRP, which began back in 1988, and has already changed the lives of dozens of youth refugees.\n\nPlease stop by sometime between 11 am and 3 pm March 18-20 to learn more about this great program, and how raising the student levy will help ensure its success.",

David's usual set up includes 10-12 Quartz Crystal Bowls, 8-10 Paiste Planet Gongs &  Santoor (Persian & Indian) Nothing is amplified, pre-recorded or rehearsed. Each set and performance is sonically pure and unique. You can purchase CDs and other merchandise at the shows with cash or cheque or online with a credit card.\n\nWe invite you to take a seat or lay down as close to the instruments as possible to get the greatest effect. Remember to bring a yoga mat, blanket and/or pillow as most venues will have floor space to lay down. Chairs for regular seating are also available. Where possible we encourage you to share rides and car pool. It not only saves gas but helps to reduce our carbon foot print on the earth and traffic.\n\n__________________________________________________\n\nAbout The Instruments:\n\n\nPaiste Gongs:\n\nPlanet Gongs are tuned to the natural harmonic series based on the orbital properties of the Earth, Moon, Sun, and Planets. All of these gongs resonate in harmony with the celestial bodies and communicate a distinct aspect of the Music of the Spheres, which was first documented by Pythagoras in the 6th Century BC. Each planet gong contributes a vital pitch to the total harmonic resonance of our solar system.\n\nCrystal Bowls:\n\nThe bowls are made of 99.992% crushed quartz crystal that is heated to 4000 degrees in a centrifugal mold. The thickness of the bowl determines the note, digitally tuned to C D E F G A and B corresponding to the charkas, our energy centers; root (C), sacral (D), solar plexus (E), heart (F), throat (G), third eye (A), and crown (B). The diameter of the bowl determines the pitch, ranging from 6 inches to 22 inches.\n\nThe archetype of the instrument may be seen in a harp, carried horizontally and struck with two sticks, found in iconographical documents of the ancient Babylonian (1600-911 BCE) and neo-Assyrian (911-612 BCE) eras.\n\nIndian Santoor (Santour)\n\nThe origin of the instrument is clear.  The name, structure, and technique point solidly to the Middle East.  Yet, there are those who attempt to trace its origins to an ancient Indian harp like instrument known as \"Vana Veena\".  There is absolutely no evidence for this latter view.  If we are to accept this proposition, then how are we to explain its 2000 year disappearance, followed by a miraculous reappearance in a form and usage that, by mere coincidence, is similar to the middle eastern santur?  It is clear that attempts to link the santur with this Vedic instrument are mere wishful thinking.  There are many people who cannot accept the concept of something great developing outside of India.\n\nSantur is an instrument indigenous to Kashmir, but nowadays played throughout the North.  It is a hammered dulcimer which is struck with light wooden mallets.  The number of strings may be as few as 24 or more than 100.  Typical sizes tend to be around 80.  It has a vibrant tone and has become very popular in the last 20 years.\n\nOne must not confuse the Indian santur with the Persian santur.  The Indian santur is box-like while the Persian version is much wider.\n\nPersian Santoor:\n\nPersian santoor consists of a trapeziform case made of walnut wood, approximately 90 cm wide at the broad end, 36 cm wide at the narrow end and 6 cm deep. The strings are fixed to hitch-pins along the left-hand side and wound round metal wrest-pins on the right by means of which they are tuned with a tuning-key (Tuning Wrench). Each quadruple set of strings rests on a movable bridge of hardwood (kharak). The bridges are placed so that the strings are divided into three sections, giving the fundamental note and two higher octaves.\n\nThere are nine (or sometimes 10, 11 and 12) quadruple strings an either side so that, with 18 groups of strings, 27 different notes can be played. The bass strings are of brass or copper and the trebles of steel.\n\nPersian santoor is played by striking the strings with two light hammers (mezrab) held in three fingers of each hand. The ends of the sticks are usually covered with cloth to soften their impact on the strings.",

GILES PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH, Banquet Hall.\n174 First Avenue, in the Glebe.\n\nSaturday & Sunday 3th & 4th May 2014\nMONTREAL\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/616344531731063\n\nThis two day workshop, taught by Miranda Gray, will enable women to work with the blessing energy directly and give a \u2018hands on\u2019 version of the Womb Blessing and Womb Healing.\nhttp://www.wombblessing.com/eng-workshops.html\n\nWorkshop early bird price $320 by April 15th*, $370 after. Deposit of $70.\n(*new date!)\n\n\u2018Moon Mothers\u2019 are women who have taken the \u2018Moon Mother\u2019 initiation personally from Miranda Gray at a Womb Blessing Training Workshop. This raises them to the high vibrational level required for them to give the transformative Womb Blessing and Womb Healing Attunement in person. The energy works to heal the three main female energy centres; the brow, the heart and the womb and the four female archetypes; the maiden, the mother, the maga and the crone. Think of the \u2018Moon Mother initiation\u2019 as a Priestess or Master initiation.\n\n\u2018Moon Mothers\u2019 are healers, combining the Womb Blessing and Womb Healing with other therapies. They are priestesses and celebrants, helping girls and women through their rites of passage, and they are companions in women\u2019s lives and on their spiritual paths. They can take an active role in spreading the Womb Blessing energy and take part in the worldwide events.\n\nThe Womb Blessing is deeply transformational and available to all women.\n\nThe Worldwide Womb Blessing events are growing in size. The Blessing in August 2013 had more than 53,000 women in 80 countries. More and more women are wishing to connect and deepen their experience of the 'authentic feminine'.\n\nMoon Mother Louise Hayden, WiseWomanWellWoman, is delighted to be hosting this event in Ottawa with Miranda Gray. \nLouise offers WiseWoman healing sessions, as womb blessing attunements & circles, and teaches regular workshops in Ottawa/Gatineau. She also hosts the Ottawa Red Tent.\nwww.wisewomanwellwoman.ca\n\nThis workshop is also being held in May in Montreal;\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/616344531731063\nand Toronto\nhttp://www.wombblessing.com/calendar.html\n\nIf you feel called to join us for this profound work please email;\ninfolouisehayden@gmail.com (Louise - Ottawa)\ninfo@atelierdesames.com (Catalina - Montreal)\nlkevic@gmail.com (Lana - Toronto)",

For more info on the broader event, visit the Parlons de la sant\u00e9 mentale 2014/Let's Talk about Mental Health 2014 event page and register. The conference is free of charge to attend and will include refreshments for participants, as well as a ton of engaging workshops on issues related to mental health.\n*******\n\nBody Image Positive is thrilled to announce its partnership with the Centre for Students w Disabilities | Centre des \u00c9tudiants ayant un Handicap for this special event as part of a day-long conference on the University of Ottawa campus.\n\nBody Talk is a bi-weekly get-together where we aim to have a little social time mixed in with good conversation, focusing on how we see our bodies, how we talk about them, and what might be some shared experiences that have contributed to our personal concepts of body image. This is an informal discussion in a safe space where all are encouraged to share their experiences.\n\nThis body talk will have a particular focus on the ideas surrounding how body image can impact our mental health.\n\nThe venue will be the Agora on the ground floor of the Jock Turcot University Centre on the University of Ottawa campus. While this event is being organized on campus, non-students are welcome to attend, and are asked to register through the CSD/CEH so that the conference organizers can plan accordingly for food and such.\n\nIf you have questions about the venue or conference, including how to get there, please don't hesitate to ask. Contact Lia from Body Image Positive at ottawa@bodyimagepositive.com if you have questions specifically about the Body Talk event, or Norah from the CSD/CEH at csd@sfuo.ca if you need more information about or would like to register for the conference.",

Both teams won gold last year and our national team is looking to keep the title! We are trying to raise as much money as possible to help the players with some of their costs associated with this tournament.\n\nTO REGISTER:\nVisit http://www.dodgeballottawa.com/tournaments.html to make payment to reserve your spot. You will also need to specify your skill level and the name of the person you want to play with (if applicable) in the \"Notes\".\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n- Players sign up INDIVIDUALLY, providing only their name and skill level.\n- The tournament committee creates balanced teams a week before the event.

Rules to be provided prior to event.\n- Battle of the Courts (optional): $5 entry, last person standing takes half the pot!\n- Skills Competitions (optional): $5 entry, details below.\n- Prizes: Winners of the tournament and skills competitions will receive prizes ... size to be determined based on number of participants\n\nSKILLS COMPETITIONS ($5 gives you entry to all 5 events):\n* Fastest throw: Throw 5 balls - highest average speed wins\n* Most accurate throw: Hit 5 different targets - most targets hit wins\n* Fastest rush: Explode to the centreline to pick up a ball, bring it back to the clear line and throw it - fastest time wins\n* Best survival: Catch, block, and dodge to survive as long as possible - best time wins\n* Guess your speed: Throw 2 balls and we will tell you the speed, then guess the speed of your 3rd throw - closest guess wins\n\n-------------------------------\nSKILL LEVEL DEFINITIONS:\n\nBeginner: Have never played or play at the Recreational level (OSSC or other leagues).\n\nIntermediate: Play at the Intermediate level (OSSC or other leagues) and understand the flow of the game and the rules.

Within the context of this graduating class, the exhibition acts as an introduction to the work of 40 emerging artists, and the beginning of their artistic careers.\n \nConsisting of work created by so many different artists, the exhibition inherently reflects the diversity present within the group, comprised of works within the fields of drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, multimedia, installation, and performance. Each artist presents work created within the final year in the program, the refined result of four years of growth and development, exploration and experimentation.\n \nExhibition Dates/Hours: Tuesday, April 22nd to Saturday, April 26th, 8 a.m. \u2013 6 p.m.\n\nVernissage: Friday, April 25th, 2014, 7-10 p.m.\n\n\u201cMeet-the-Artist\u201d Open House: Tuesday, April 22nd, 3 \u2013 7 p.m.",

We'll facilitate a short brainstorming session and have tons of creative ways for people to get their voices out there. If you're more crafty than chatty (or vice versa), we got you covered!  And of course, we'll have some snacks, too.\n\nCome for the snacks, stay for the revolution! \n\nThe official goal of this event is to bring together our allies to develop concrete messaging around gender-based violence for 2014 municipal candidates. We're going to aggregate the messages from the event onto our website where we'll have a little hub that basically boils down to: \"You want my vote? This is what I expect of you!\" \n\nOur unofficial goal is to bring together like-minded folks in a chill, welcoming space to talk about the reality of street harassment and what we, as a community, want to see done about it. \n\nLet's make gender-based violence a priority in this city!\n\nWant more info? ottawa@ihollaback.org\n\nNOTE: \nThe space is accessible.\n\nThis is a SAFE space. If you don't think gender-based violence is a 'thing' or you're a giant jerk, stay home.\n\nThis is an event designed for community members. If you're a candidate, GREAT that you want to know what people are thinking! BUT! We'll be aggregating all the feedback  for folks like you to check out at a later date. So, we ask that you stay home, too and allow residents a safe space to chat among themselves.",

Apr\u00e8s Satie: Four Two and Four Hands is a poetry collection inspired by Erik Satie's piano compositions.  Moody, often surreal in tone and content, the interplay of primo and secondo voices in these poems raises our awareness of the temporal nature of all things.\n\nAMANDA EARL is the managing editor of Bywords.ca and the publisher of AngelHousePress, including its transgressive prose imprint, DevilHouse. She is the author of several chapbooks. Her first poetry book will be published by Chaudiere Books in the fall of 2014. Her poems have also appeared in literary journals both on line and in print in Australia, Canada, England, France, Ireland and the USA. Amanda has received funding from the City of Ottawa and the Ontario Arts Council. \n\nDEAN STEADMAN\u2019s work has been published in Canadian journals and e-zines, as well as in the anthology Pith and Wry: Canadian Poetry (Scrivener Press, 2010).

        "description": "The Awakening is an invitation to a new experience of your self, your life, your friends, family and the world.\n\nMost of what appear to be external obstacles in life are really internal ones. We complain about him or her, this or that, and convince ourselves that if things outside of ourselves would change, our experience of life would change. But our internal landscape determines our experience of the external one. Perception is not a window, it is a mirror.\n\nThis is a workshop about the spiritual dilemma that underlies and translates into the psychological drama of our daily lives. You will be presented with an internal map, based on A Course in Miracles, of the dynamics of the psychological defense system that is revolutionary and universal in application. This can be a life altering moment, delivered at the level of experience rather than restricted to intellect and insight.\n\nThe Awakening is a creative, empowering, process oriented weekend, focusing in depth on the relinquishment of a thought system based on fear for a thought system based on love.",
