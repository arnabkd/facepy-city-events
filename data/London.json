South London Ordnance / October / Otto & Farr Residents\n\nTICKETS\nRSN: http://bit.ly/1oIybpy\nFire : http://bit.ly/randommagicFIRE\nResident Advisor :  http://bit.ly/1ctFBwE\n  \nSaturday 3rd May 2014 | 10pm - 7am \nFIRE, South Lambeth Rd, London SW8 1RT  \n_____________________\n \nRANDOM MAGIC steps out of the shadows and into the Spring-time for the second night in their series of music, magic and dancing taking place over the May Bank Holiday at FIRE.\n  \nThis time they bring something rather special as they conjure up a UK exclusive with house don CAJMERE performing back to back with his own alias GREEN VELVET. Change has been a constant theme throughout the successful career of Curtis Alan Jones, but as he's crossed genres, explored themes from the comedic to the serious and changed monikers, the common thread running through the music he has made for nearly two decades and both his Cajual and Relief labels is its roots in and dedication to the Chicago House sound. For this very special appearance Curtis will be donning both of his hats and performing two special sets. Think lots of smoke and green lights and some rather stunning music.\n \nAlso in FIRE's main room will be Nonplus label head BODDIKA. With incredible collaborations between himself and Joy Orbsion, one half of the highly respected Instra:mental, one third of Autonomic and solo as Boddika, these past few years have marked Al Green out as one of the UK club music's most restless innovators.\n \nThe Classic Recording Company's leader LUKE SOLOMON and the amazing musical mind that is NEVILLE WATSON play back to back, warming this room to perfection. Luke returns to Random Magic after a spell-binding performance at Halloween to play an extended set with Neville Watson, the master of revivalist house.  \n\nTaking over the second room of FIRE will be FARR FESTIVAL. Just 5 years young Farr has grown into one of the most well-respected boutique festivals in the country. With this year's festival stepping up a gear this will be the London launch for the festival. For the celebrations they'll be bringing with them Hot Flush's SOUTH LONDON ORDNANCE who has made musical waves with his Swamp 81-esque percussive house and techno sounds and Stockholm's OCTOBER from SKUDGE Records. In support will be OTTO & FARR RESIDENTS.\n  \nRandom Magic's last event back in October saw the likes of Omar S, Maxxi Soundsystem, Horse Meat Disco, Luke Solomon, Honey Dijon (Live) put the Funktion 1 Sound System to the test.  Taking the spring solstice, morris dancers and maypoles as inspiration for this party, Random Magic is back to wow with more sporadic gatherings and late night happenings. \n\nwww.randommagic.co.uk \nwww.firelondon.net\nwww.magicandmedicine.com",

        "description": "When the Equinox lands this Thursday the 20th of March, you have the opportunity to make a real difference to the lives of innocent animals by protesting the capture and slaughter of dolphins that is an atrocious annual tradition in Japan\u2019s Taiji Cove. \n\nThe little cove\u2019s dirty great secret was uncovered in 2003, when marine conservation society Sea Shepherd released images of the now infamous \u2018bloody cove\u2019 \u2013 revealing the epicentre of the annual murder of 20 000 dolphins, porpoises and small whales which occurs in Japan every year between September and March. Since 2010 Sea Shepherd has maintained an ongoing presence of volunteers standing watch on the Cove site, known as The Cove Guardians. \n\nAustralian Cove Guardian Emillie describes the scene she witnessed at Taiji Cove\u2026\n\n\u201cA pod of 250 bottlenose dolphins spent days netted in the cove while their family unit was torturously torn apart. Dolphins deemed worthy for a life of captivity were stolen away. The remainder waited - disoriented, frightened and hungry until the eventual slaughter. On an almost daily basis I continued to witness intelligent, wild and free dolphin pods systematically driven into the cove only to depart as a commodity, either as a petrified prisoner or lifeless meat for human consumption. Every day, six months of the year, this is the reality of Taiji. And it is a visibly decaying town, symbolic of its archaic practices.\u201d\n\nThe Japanese government maintain that Taiji is part of a cultural tradition, and yet the evidence is clear that this is a commercially driven endeavour, with the animals ending up in captivity, on the food market, or simply left injured in the oceans to die. Unlike whales, dolphins do not have an international organisation to offer them protection, so it really is down to us - the people of the international community to care enough to take action for these animals which scientists are increasingly discovering to be highly intelligent, emotional and social beings. \n\nMomentum is building rapidly for the opposition of dolphin and whale slaughter and capture in the form of global protests, a viral storm of Internet activity and media coverage including high profile documentaries. In 2009 the Academy Award winning documentary The Cove was released, featuring Richard O\u2019Barry, a former dolphin capturer and trainer for the TV Series Flipper, who later dedicated his life to preventing the very same practice. The impact of this film now looks set to be matched by the recent release of the documentary Blackfish, which chillingly reveals the immorality and tragic consequences of keeping orca whales in captivity. \n\nContinued pressure is crucial. This Equinox Protest will act as a follow up to the extremely successful protest event of February 20th, during which over 1000 people arrived outside the Japanese embassy to show their derision at the Japanese government\u2019s continued support of the annual slaughter. \n\nThe world is waking up to the horrific reality of Taiji cove, but nothing will change unless we turn our awareness into action. Please join us at the protest on March 20th, to show Japan and the world that we no longer accept this and bring about a change desperately overdue.",

It facilitates collaborative innovation, fosters transparency and guarantees the potential for equivalence in decision making.  \"The practical nature of Sociocracy, as experienced in the workshop filled me with inspiration. I've often felt powerless and before the workshop I had the strong feeling \u201cthere has to be a better way\u201d.  After the workshop I felt, \u201cyes, I am starting to get my groove back\u201d. \nEileen, Independent Translator and Copywriter\n\n\"This was not an easy workshop, with  the steep learning curve of Sociocratic process and a two year old conflict waiting to be resolved, battling for supremacy\u2026 The facilitators art was such we learned the processes while in process! We never lost a member to boredom, ( much) or from the room, (for long) in the two long days of  the workshop.\" \nRoz - Co-housing resident - UK\n\nAlthough I had read the book \u201cWe the people\u201d twice and already had done some practical work with Sociocracy the course gave me a much deeper understanding of  how Sociocracy integrates human wisdom, natural organizational design and how this is realised by the Sociocracy principles and practices. Understanding the purpose and intent behind the principles will make me able to adapt practices and handle challenging situations. Now I am really exited to facilitate and implement Sociocracy on a new level.\" \nMichael Gothe - Agile Coach, Stockholm\n\n\"I didn\u2019t know anything about Sociocracy before hand. The course presented a good overview and it was easy to grasp the effectiveness of the method. I\u2019m active in Transition Gothenburg and I will support every initiative to introduce Sociokrati in our network.\" \nSusanne - Transition Gothenburg\n\n\"Thank you for a great weekend. You presented outstanding material in a personal, present and powerful way. I came back with many tools to get started implementing Sociocracy.\"\nMatteas - RAW & Green Earth, Stockholm\n\n\"This workshop gave me a deeper appreciation for the sociocratic principles and values. I felt fully engaged, had lot of fun, learned a lot, and received much value from the interactions with the instructor and the other participants. I particularly appreciated the focus on experiential learning. I highly recommend this workshop for anyone who wants to improve their understanding of sociocracy!\"\nJan  - Global Process Improvement Manager, ABB, Sweden",

Sad, funny, intense, bizarre, fascinating, welcome to Melingo\u2019s wry bohemian universe \u2013 a fabulous, boozy, theatrical milieu where Tolstoy, Kafka, Piaf, Brecht, Waits and Cohen might find solace and unsettled lodging.\n\nTonight Melingo launches  his new album Linyera, offbeat love songs, sparkling with glints of the blues and tangos of old, vagrants\u2019 tales sprinkled with snatches of bossa nova and candombe, atmospheric melodies summoning up musical spirits, now of Duke, now of Zappa, all plunging us into Melingo\u2019s surreal universe.  In the company of his band of itinerant musician-poets, he is a free-spirited, definition-defying artist at the very zenith of his powers.  Part rocker, part flamboyant crooner, with a touch of the comedian, as well as a multi-instrumentalist and composer, he bewitches us with intoxicating dreams.\n\n\u201cThe man who makes Tango seriously cool!\u201d The Independent\n\n\u201cA mesmerising stage presence.\u201d The Times\n\n\u201cImagine a proud hybrid of Paolo Conte and Ian Dury, with the facial mannerisms of a silent-film heavy.\u201d The Guardian\n\nDaniel Melingo: vocals, clarinet\nMuhammad Habbibi el Rodra Guerra: electric guitar, saw\nPedro  Onetto:  piano,\n\u201cMarques\u201d Gustavo  Paglia: bandone\u00f3n\nPatricio  Cotella: double bass\n\nTickets \u00a315 plus booking fee\n\nBUY TICKETS ONLINE\nVia venue:  https://tickets.southbankcentre.co.uk/booking/production/syos/82323?performance=\n\nTicketmaster: http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/Melingo-tickets/artist/1967323?dcc=\n\nTicket Web: http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/event/melingo-tickets/109375\n\nSee Tickets: http://www.seetickets.com/event/melingo-la-linea/queen-elizabeth-hall/769372",

The FUSE London label launched a couple of years later as a platform for our residents and friends to release their tracks, which had been tried and tested on the FUSE faithful. \n\nOn Sunday 23rd March, we\u2019d like to invite you all to come and party with us at Village Underground from 3pm until midnight because we\u2019re throwing one hell of a party to celebrate three massive years of FUSE London. \n\nWith sets from seven great Djs, the label\u2019s third birthday will definitely be one to remember. Playing some of the most-loved material from the past, present and future, our DJs will take you through an aural journey of the very best in Fusic. From Enzo Siragusa\u2019s debut Sagamore EP to Enzo and Alexkid\u2019s Kilimijaro project, Seb Zito's Seven Dials EP, Rich NxT's forthcoming Wasteline EP and the hugely popular Fuse Volume series.This is going to be one serious party.\n \nNow encompassing sub-label INFUSE, the productions just keep on coming and with huge support from both established and up and coming Djs alike, there are no signs of slowing down. \n\nThe label releases have seen our sound spread far and wide, culminating in global gigs for our residents everywhere from South Africa to Switzerland. With our residents and friends constantly making music in the studio, this next year will see even more releases and even more parties around the world. But as we return to our London home, we want to celebrate with the people who have partied with us since the very beginning.\n\nSee you on the dance floor. \n\n\nFollow FUSE on Twitter: @FUSE_London\n\nPlease add the Fuse Fan Page:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/FUSELondon\n\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\u2580\n\u2605 OPEN 3PM \u2013 MIDNIGHT\n\u2605 FUSE IS A GUEST LIST ONLY PARTY\n\u2605 TO GET ON THE LIST VISIT OUR WEBSITE WWW.FUSELONDON.NET\n\u2605 GUEST LIST REQUESTS MUST BE RECEIVED BY 12PM\n\nPlease be aware that being on the guest list does not 100% guarantee entrance.

        "description": "For our first London Kumasi party of 2014 we've lined up something rather special for you. An exclusive 250 person intimate all-night rave in a true gem of a studio space which has never previously been used before for music events. Spread over 3 interlinking chambers and a main 2-tiered mezzanine studio space, we invite you to run and rave amok to the sounds of our choice Kumasi Music guests in this spine-tingling setting.\n\nHeadind the bill is Kumasi Music favourite, Rayko. Spanish producer extraordinaire Rayko has been a leading light in the nu-disco edits scene for the past 5 years. Deeply rooted in '70s and '80s disco, funk, boogie and rock, Rayko's influences are masterfully interpreted and transformed into modern day dancefloor bombs. His mind-blowing edit of Candi Staton's 'Broadway' was Juno's #1 disco record of 2011, and his exquisite remix of Barbara Keith's 'All Along The Watchtower' has racked up a whopping 136,000 Soundcloud plays - a platform which he has amassed over 22,000 followers. Rayko's DJ sets are stuff of legend, as such we're delighted to secure his services for our first all-night session of 2014.\n\nMatt Fear continues his Kumasi Music residency and will purvey his bass-heavy interpretation of the slower nu-disco/house sound that has found such popularity across world dancefloors of recent times. Never one to dissapoint, his latest remix for Kumasi (out February) takes us on a typically emotionally charged bass led journey to the basement, warehouse, and back again with a sublime cut of jacking tech-house artistry. Playfully tossing us one way then the next, Fear's rework of Matteo Floris's 'Dance!' makes you do exactly what it says on the tin, and is all set to destroy dancefloors across the globe.\n\nItaly-born Barcelona based Kumasi new signing Matteo Floris has provided us with our first EP of 2014. Both 'Dance!' and 'Let Me Tell Ya' are beautifully crafted tracks in their own right, and we can't wait to hear them loud and proud on March 22nd. London duo Tainted Souls round off the bill, armed to the teeth with the kind of big-hitting releases which have seen them be signed to such labels as Amine Edge & DANCE's 'CUFF', Kolombo's 'LouLou' and Rob Made's 'Sleazy Deep' imprints.\n\nExpect the usual high level Kumasi production and visuals throughout the space. Earlybird tickets are on sale now at the bargain January Sale price of only \u00a35! \n\nSee you in the S-S-Studios!\n\nKumasi x\n\n// Venue TBA // Tickets: \u00a35/8/10 // 10pm-5am\nTICKETS: http://residentadvisor.net/kumasi\nEVENT ROLL CALL: http://residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?559189\nINFO: http://kumasimusic.net\nEMAIL/GUESTLIST: info@kumasimusic.net\n\nConnect with us:\n@ Soundcloud - http://soundcloud.com/kumasimusic\n@ Facebook - http://facebook.com/kumasimusic\n@ Twitter - http://twitter.com/kumasimusic",

        "description": "Wednesday March 19th, 2014\nKonkrete Jungle Minneapolis Presents: \n\n\n\nMAMPI SWIFT - Charge Recordings - London, UK\n\nwww.facebook.com/mampiswiftrecordings\n\nThe very definition of a legend, Mampi Swift has been involved in the drum & bass scene since the early 90\u2019s. It was in 1990 that Swift started DJing and found himself behind the counter of Lucky Spin records. With access to the studio next door and an in-house engineer, Swift jumped at the valuable opportunity to start learning how to produce. Releases soon started filtering out with labels like Suburban Base, True Playaz, Trouble On Vinyl & Frontline all taking tracks.\n\n1997 saw the launch of Charge Recordings, and a slur of releases that saw him rise meteorically to the top of the DnB tree. With the release of \u2018The One\u2019, Swift became a household name and he showed no signs of slowing up, following that up with the likes of \u2018Hi Tek\u2019, \u2018Touch Of J\u2019, \u2018Jaws\u2019 and \u2018Trippin\u2019. The label went from strength to strength and has since seen releases from Fresh, Friction, Blame, Sigma, Gridlok and more.\n\nIn the DJ booth, Mampi is a force to be reckoned with and it\u2019s arguably where he feels most at home. A pioneer of the double drop style of DJing alongside Andy C, his unmistakeable presence behind the decks has formed the back bone of many a line up from the UK to the States and everywhere in between. A true originator he has influenced and shaped the scene like few others.\n\nAfter a couple of years out, Mampi Swift & Charge Recordings are back in the biggest way. The long awaited \u2018History LP\u2019 has been heavily supported by the likes of Andy C, MistaJam, Friction, Hype, Crissy Criss & Bailey. Tracks such as 'Gangster', 'Soldiers' & 'The Silence' have been destroying dance floors worldwide! Fast forward to Autumn 2013 and surely a career highlight for Swift as his monstrous remix of Dizzee Rascal's 'I Dont Need A Reason' took his profile to another level. The track was featured heavily on both mainstream & underground radio, and was critically acclaimed to be \"The most most disgusting slice of D&B in the last 5 years!\" - Zane Lowe.\n\nExpect big things in 2014 - There is so much more to come!\n\n\nWith Konkrete Jungle Residents:\n\nEasyrider | MBC | Greensky\n\nTime Slots:\n\nGreensky 11-11:15\nEasyrider 11:15-12:30\nMampi Swift 12:30-1:00\nHosted by:\n\nBrace | Hyde | Kaspa\n\n\n$10 Presale | $12 Door\n18 to enter | 21 to Drink\nPresales available at http://first-avenue.com/\n\nThe Record Room @ First Avenue Nightclub\n701 First Avenue North, Minneapolis, MN 55403\n\nJoin us on the web:\nhttp://www.myspace.com/kj_minneapolis\nhttps://www.facebook.com/group/KonkreteJungleMinneapolis",

D'Julz, Bill Patrick, Ben Annand, Patrick Gil, Max Gardner, Brian Knarfield, Bob Five, Bells & Whistles, + a Special Guest that just happens to be in town... ;)\n\nSunday, March 23rd, 2014\n12:PM - 12:AM\n\nLine-up /\nD'JULZ (Bass Culture-Paris)\nBILL PATRICK (ROBOTS, Supplement Facts | Berlin/NYC)\nBEN ANNAND (Tropical-LA) \nPATRICK GIL (Direct to Earth/DeepLabs, Gynoid Audio)\nMAX GARDNER (Direct to Earth)\nBRIAN KNARFIELD (Direct to Earth)\nBOB FIVE (Direct to Earth)\nBELLS & WHISTLES (Four Sweaters / AYLI -SF) \n+ A Special Guest That Just Happens To Be In Town\n\n///\n\nD'JULZ (Bass Culture Records | Paris)\nwww.djulz.com/\nwww.lola-ed.com/artists/djulz\nwww.facebook.com/djulz\nwww.residentadvisor.net/dj/djulz\n\nWhether it\u2019s through his productions, radio shows, compilations, parties or club sets, D'Julz has been at the forefront of electronic music since his career first began back in 1992. A firm DJ and fan favourite alike, his ability to transcend genres and trends has seen him hold one of the most consistent levels of success of any modern-\u00ad\u2010day DJ/Producer. A run of form that is at its strongest, today.\nD'Julz's early career saw him make an instant impact in his home city of Paris, spinning at many of the city's early raves and legendary clubs. A hugely successful move to New York in 1993 quickly furthered his reputation, and upon his return to Europe he found himself to be in high demand, playing key clubs in Belgium, Holland, the UK and Ibiza.\n\n1997 saw the birth of his now legendary 'Bass Culture' night at Rex Club, Paris. The monthly party has become the longest running event in the club\u2019s history, and in 2009 gave its name to D'Julz's highly successful record label. His impact on the club was further celebrated in 2010 when he was asked to mix the debut Rexperience compilation of the series, coinciding with the 15th year of the Bass Culture parties.\n\nProducing since the mid 90's, his music has featured on some of the world\u2019s finest labels \u201320:20 Vision, Dessous, Pokerflat, Safari, Get Physical, Mobilee, Rekids, Systematic, 100% Pure \u2013 tracks and remixes that have become essential weapons in the record boxes of the world's elite. 2008's \u2018Just so You Know\u2019 on Ovum and 'Fleurette' on Circus Company became instant classics, as did his debut EP on Bass Culture \u2018Fofoca\u2019. His remixes of Slam's 'Positive Education' on Soma, Barem\u2019s \u2018Is\u2019 on M_nus and Franck Roger\u2019s \u2018After All\u2019 on Real Tone, have all ruled the DJ and download charts alike.\n\nD'Julz continues to travel the world playing the likes of fabric London, Panorama Bar Berlin, Amnesia Ibiza, not to mention regular appearances at the infamous Circoloco, DC10 . The future has never been more exciting for the Frenchman as Bass Culture label grows from strength to strength, and as a producer he continues to raise the bar with recent releases like \u2018Special Day\u2019 on Circus Company. Recently becoming the newest addition to Lola ED agency, 2013 see D\u2019Julz join the like-\u00ad\u2010minded Parisian crew of some of the most in-\u00ad\u2010demand underground house and techno artists.\n\n///\n\nBILL PATRICK (Robots, Supplement Facts | Berlin/NYC)\nwww.soundcloud.com/billpatrick\nwww.residentadvisor.net/dj/billpatrick\nwww.facebook.com/billpatrick.ny\n\nIn America, specifically NYC, Bill Patrick is a man of many accolades... Since his days as a DJ in legendary clubs such as The Limelight, Vinyl & Arc, he has charmed our hearts and moved our bodies. Not to mention being co-founder of the famed Robots parties and amusing us weekly as Robot Radio's alluring and witty host. Within the world of electronic music everyone has a tale about our friend Bill Patrick. Some funny, some sad, some tragic, most shady, but at the end of each story or any encounter with this demi god you're left wanting more.\n\nIn 2008, this mythical creature, who by chance was reborn a man, relocated to Berlin. Why? Few know. Some say it was in search of gold, some suggest it was out of self loathing, those in his inner circle say it was to be closer to them. He says it was to challenge the European state of mind and how sexually active they, as a people, can become. In any event all legend and lore were left behind. So where has that left this man, this nu-romantic? I'll tell you, striving to be more. It doesn't matter that the only place he now plays are mega festivals like Sunwaves in Romania, or super clubs like DC10, Fabric, and Rex in Paris. Currently holding the A&R title for Guy Gerber's Supplement Facts label and hosting his wildly popular radio show, Private Stock on Pulse Radio, Bill still finds time to update his Facebook fan page and send out extremely well written tweets. But he wants to step out of his box and come to you, to educate the minds of the world with his deep, psychedelic take on contemporary dance music. With the help of his unwavering comrades; Seth Troxler, Guy Gerber, Ryan Crosson and Shaun Reeves, he is destined to thrive!\n\n- Words by Seth Troxler\n\n///\n\nBEN ANNAND (Moontribe, Tropical House, LA)\nwww.soundcloud.com/ben-annand\nwww.facebook.com/benannandmusic\nwww.residentadvisor.net/profile/benannand\n\nBen Annand has been djing and producing events based from his home in Los Angeles since 1996.  In his zone on vinyl, CDJs, or both, he pairs impeccably smooth mixing skills with a dynamic mixing style that keeps the music moving.  His music is dreamy, atmospheric and deep, crossing the genres of house, tech-house and techno and defying categorization strictly in one.  \n\nBuying his first records at 23rd Precinct in Edinburgh Scotland in the summer of 96, Ben returned to the States determined to learn how to mix records and was already thinking about the future, declaring his next trip to Europe would be when he was paid to dj there.  He was a quick study and started playing out at parties in late 1997, had his first international gig in Quito, Ecuador in January 1999 and followed that with a summer 1999 Moontribe Tour in Canada.  In 2000 he made 5 trips to Mexico City\u2019s Club Rimel, 1 to Guadalajara, and closed out the Jazz stage of the Aca World Sound Festival in Acapulco.   Within 5 years of first trying to match 2 beats together, Ben accomplished his Europe goal with pizazz in May 2001 with a 6-gig, 4-country tour that ranged from a small club in a 13th century building in Portugal, to the 20,000 person Festimad in Madrid, a 10-year running underground warehouse party in the UK, and finally ending at the now world-famous Propaganda Club in Moscow.\n\nFrom 2001-2010 Ben became rather famous in Russia as one of the top-booked dis at Propaganda with 13 visits in those years, appearing on a one-hour show Russian National Television which aired to over 2 million people, and djing outside of Moscow in 9 other Russian cities spread across its 9 time zones - St.Petersburg, Murmansk, Ekaterinburg, Chelyabinsk, Magnitigorsk, Sakhalin, Krasnoyarsk, Saratov and Orenburg (where he was the first American dj ever).\n\nIn that time he also made several trips to Spain, playing in Madrid, La Coruna, Santiago de Campostela, Vigo, and Lloret de Mar.  In 2007 he notched one of the world\u2019s top honors for a tech-house dj, playing for in London for Nathan Coles at Wiggle at Fabric.  His success was not confined to Europe; in both 2007 and 2008 he played the Labyrinth Festival in Japan, which many top djs consider the best house/techno festival in the world.  \n\nThe past three years have seen a shift in focus for Ben from international touring to becoming rooted closer to home, establishing himself on the West Coast USA Festival circuit with peak-time appearances at Photosynthesis (WA), Esthetic Evolution (ID), and Desert Hearts (CA) among many others, while continuing his 16-year running residency with Moontribe, one of Southern California\u2019s original outdoor events and one which has influenced most other outdoor parties on the West Coast.  He also continues organizing his own nonprofit event, Tropical, which stands out amongst Socal parties for having given its participants extras like free smoothies and massage and in the early days, mixtapes, while over the years while also making a positive impact on the outside community with over $13,000 in charitable donations to date.\n\nThe number and caliber of gigs Ben played all over the world in the first 15 years of his career is a testament to his being one of the more skilled and unique djs out there.  Having not produced any tracks over this span, he has always been hired for his skill and has truly succeeded on an underground level, fully focused on his mixing and providing memorable nights of music to partygoers.  Yet as his vision matured Ben became more and more interested on the idea of making his own music and finally released his first track on Laus Recordings in June 2012.  Wanting to improve on the result, Ben began taking voice and piano lessons shortly thereafter to better understand music theory and take some of the music making off the computer.  In 2014 he continues with voice and piano lessons and has begun integrating his knowledge (and voice) into projects using Maschine, Ableton Live, and Logic Pro.  Look for his next release in the near future.\n\n/// \n\nNIKITA (listed, London Calling | SF)\nwww.facebook.com/TheOfficialDJNikita\nwww.soundcloud.com/djnikita\nwww.residentadvisor.net/dj/nikita\n\nOn the same day Dolly Parton, Janis Joplin, Edgar Allen Poe, his mother and grandmother were born, so too did San Francisco DJ NIKITA begin his enchanted existence. As a young boy in Denver, Colorado, NIKITA's childhood was similar to that of other creative youth, days filled with singing, playing the piano, and dancing to his mother's R&B albums. From an early age, NIKITA always knew he wanted to be an entertainer. Then, in 1993, a chance encounter with house music at an underground warehouse party would prove to be a pivotal moment in his life, ultimately guiding NIKITA towards the charmed life he lives today.\n\nIt wasn't until the turn of the millennium though that NIKITA would leave his home in Colorado to search the clubs and warehouses of San Francisco for his destiny. At the very least, he would get a degree in music business from San Francisco State University. But with a resounding perseverance and an inimitable personality, NIKITA quickly earned his place among the upper echelon of DJs in San Francisco's world-renowned club scene. In 2005, NIKITA was chosen to host his own radio show, The Massive Mix, on Northern California's only electronic dance music radio station, Energy 92.7 FM. Indeed, it was NIKITA's penchant for blending raw grooves with sophisticated sounds that garnered him a residency at San Francisco's legendary nightclub, The EndUp.\n\nNIKITA is a DJ's DJ, a rare soul who truly understands his role in the DJ booth. Performing anywhere from two to twelve hour sets, NIKITA weaves music into fantastic journeys of rhythm and sound. NIKITA's ability to contrast the harder elements of techno with the soulful sensuality of deep house has garnered him accolades from some of the world's best DJs and allowed him the rare opportunity to tag team alongside the likes of Lee Burridge, Cassy and Derek Plaslaiko. Indeed, NIKITA has played with a Who's Who of international talent, including Danny Howells, Loco Dice, Steve Lawler, Craig Richards, Steve Bug, Joel Mull, Adam Beyer, Damian Lazurus, M.A.N.D.Y. and many, many more. With additional inspiration coming from friends such as Ms. Honey Dijon, Tedd Patterson and Danny Tenaglia, it comes as no wonder why NIKITA's story is one of a dream come true.\n\nwritten by Jack O'Shaughnessy\n\n///\n\nPATRICK GIL (DeepLabs, Direct to Earth, Gynoid Audio)\nSoundcloud.com/patrickgil\nFacebook.com/Patrickgilmusic\nResidentadvisor.net/DJ/patrickgil\nhttp://www.directtoearth.com\n\nPatrick has lived in California all his life, and it shapes his interpretation of electronic music. Raised in the 90's and 00's on psychedelic rock, jazz, electronica, indie, singer songwriter - and later on - techno and house music, he finds strains of inspiration through the music he was exposed to and has been creating since age 15. He works as a live sound and video production engineer, as well as an event producer in San Francisco; and has successfully found a way to merge his career and passion into a happy medium, that translates into his body of work. \n\nHis production technique is shaped by analog synthesizers, guitar pedals, software tricks, far-out samples, and dub techniques. His productions have appeared at the likes of Berghain/Panorama Bar, Space Club Ibiza, Fabric London, Movement Festival Detroit, Slam Radio, and other various radio shows and podcasts all over the world. He believes in simple and spacious sounds that translate into an open canvas for every DJ to interpret his own story through. \n\nAs a DJ himself, he prefers long, smooth and spacious mixing and storytelling through the slow build. He seeks the same qualities in the music he plays as the produces. Lush but dissonant, slow grooving but jacking; he tries always to find the 'in-between' sounds that stretch out the minds of listeners and dancers. He prefers to play without a computer, and keeps the mixes smooth and tight, with bits of surprises along the way.  2014 is looking positive with many gigs,  the launch of his own vinyl imprint called 'Pressed Friends', as well as forthcoming pieces of wax on CMYK and Space.\n\n///\n\nBRIAN KNARFIELD (Direct to Earth)\nwww.beatport.com/artist/brian-knarfield/103921\nwww.residentadvisor.net/dj/brianknarfield/\nwww.facebook.com/Brianknarfield\nwww.soundcloud.com/brian-knarfield\nhttp://www.directtoearth.com/\n\nIt was the  summer of 2000 when Brian ditched space camp to learned to spin. The intensity of school and the threatening thoughts of staying a Mobile DJ forever began to poke and jab as the years went on. Brian began producing and  playing Techno-inspired beats under the Knarfield (\"gnar-field\") moniker in 2008 . in 2011 Brian Co-founded the Direct to Earth Party crew and continues to express himself musically at DTE events, while also captivating strangers at other affairs. \n\n///\n\nMAX GARDER (Direct to Earth)\nwww.facebook.com/maxgardner.dte\nwww.residentadvisor.net/dj/maxgardner\nwww.soundcloud.com/max-gardner\nwww.dj.beatport.com/maxgardner\n\nMax's style is all over the spectrum of electronic music: ranging from playful minimal and house, to deep techno and experimental productions.  As a student in Arizona, he was raising the bar for underground music. The originality of his DJ sets had him quickly recognized throughout the state and he became a regular performer at large-scale events featuring big name guests. He was playing music that was completely new to his region, regardless of when it was actually released. With a heady, yet distinguished taste, Max set himself apart from his peers. Eventually, his love for deeper and more experimental sounds led him back to his natural habitat of the San Francisco bay area.\n\nAfter settling down Max refocused his direction towards jam sessions in the studio. He strived to find his own sound by working hard on mastering his gear and developing his own production technique. As a result of being surrounded by a wide range of electronic sounds, Max decided to team up with music aficionado, Brian Knarfield and founded the event series Direct To Earth (DTE), originally based out of Oakland, CA. DTE continues to provide a home for techno and the underground dance music community throughout the bay area.\n\nSince the move, Max has performed at shows featuring artists such as Dustin Zahn, Luke Hess, Troy Pierce, Raiz, Max Cooper, Heiko Laux, Pig & Dan, Tim Xavier, Timo Maas, Marco Bailey, [a]pendics.shuffle, Jay Tripwire, Evil Eddie Richards, Barem, Noah Pred, Nico Stojan, Echospace, Sante, Hollen, Harvey Mckay and Octave among many others. He's also released his first EP with Seeder and saw it reach #11 on the Beatport minimal charts. Max feels out the dancefloor. He can sense what they want. Sometimes he plays raw, gritty, heavy and experimental; other times it's more inviting, friendly, and groovy. While pushing the limits and trying new things, he commonly sneaks original productions into his DJ sets.  \n\nMax always has fun behind the decks, and it truly shows. With an exquisite taste in sound, seemless mixing and an intelligent track selection, he's a master at setting the vibe just how he wants it.  He is a frequent performer at the bay area\u2019s most celebrated nightclubs and undergrounds, and has also made appearances in Las Vegas, Colorado, Black Rock City, and throughout Arizona.\n\n///\n\nBOB FIVE (Direct to Earth, Star Kommand)\nwww.facebook.com/i.m.bob.five\nwww.soundcloud.com/bobfive\nwww.residentadvisor.net/dj/bobfive\nhttp://www.directtoearth.com\n\nbob five roots run deeps in san francisco underground house/techno world.

        "description": "Tues 29 April: THE GARAGE http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/event/AJI29041?camefrom=CFC_UK_MAMA_GARAGE&brand=thegarage\nSat 3 May: THE SURYA http://www.seetickets.com/event/honest-plain-john/surya/778452\nSat 10 May: HOPE & ANCHOR\nFri 27 June: THE WATER RATS\n\nHONEST JOHN PLAIN to play his first solo band gigs in London in 10 years.\n\nHonest John Plain met Matt Dangerfield at Art College in Leeds and moved to London with him in 1971.  Dangerfield, joined London SS with Casino Steel, Mick Jones (The Clash), Tony James (Generation X) and Brian James (The Damned) with Plain joining them on drums for one session.  As London SS disintegrated in 1975 Plain, Dangerfield and Steel formed The Boys.  \n\nThe Boys quickly built up a reputation as a white-hot live band and in January 1977 became the first punk band to sign an album deal when they signed away their recording lives to NEMS.  After signing for NEMS Plain sold The Boys equipment for \u00a3500 and put it on a horse, which came second!  This and other dodgy deals quickly earned him the nickname \u2018Honest\u2019.\n\nWidely tipped to make it big The Boys had an arsenal of killer songs penned by Steel/Dangerfield & Plain and were highly respected by both the music press and their peers.  They quickly became known as \u2018The Beatles of Punk\u2019 but unfortunately through a series of poor marketing, bad decisions and appalling luck they never converted their potential to chart success.  However they still managed to record four killer albums and release several sure-fire hit singles before finally calling it a day in the summer of 1981.  During 1978/79 Siobhan Fahay (later of Bananarama) and Hazel O\u2019Connor ran The Boys fan club.  In 1979 Plain had a brief spell with The Lurkers and co-wrote their hit single \u201cNew Guitar In Town\u201d with guitarist Pete Stride whom he subsequently recorded an album, aptly titled \u201cNew Guitars In Town.\n\nAfter the demise of The Boys Plain joined the Dirty Strangers and recorded an album with Keith Richards and Ronnie Woods of the Rolling Stones.  In August 1984 he joined The Mannish Boys.  Managed by Denny Laine\u2019s wife Jo Jo they quickly built up a live following and interest from several record companies before agreeing a deal with Motown.  Unfortunately the band were dropped as soon as Motown found out they were white!  \n\nBy this time German punk band Die Toten Hosen were beginning to make an impact across Europe and their lead singer Campino made it known that his favourite band of all time were The Boys.  He offered a support slot to the Tower Block Rockers on the proviso that they could persuade Plain to join the band.  Plain quickly came to realise that he and Tower Block Rockers guitarist Darrell Bath formed a formidable writing/performing partnership and they formed the Crybabys who were voted \u2018Best New Band of 1991\u2019 in Kerrang Magazine.\n\n1n 1993 Plain recorded his first solo album \u201cHonest John Plain & Friends\u201d, which featured guest appearances from many of his friends including Dangerfield, Bath, Robbie Rushton, Campino and Vom Ritchie.  Plain\u2019s second solo album \u201cHonest John Plain & Amigos\u201d was released on 12 May 2003 to great critical acclaim and consequently Plain formed a new band to promote it.  His old mate Robbie Rushton (Crybabys, Mannish Boys, The Gunslingers) was brought in on drums with Mat Sargent (Sham 69, Chelsea, Splodge) joining on bass.  They made their debut as headlining act at the Punk Is Dead Festival in Holland on 17 October 2003 followed by a European tour.  \n\nHonest John Plain & The Amigos debut album \u201cOne More And We\u2019re Staying was released on 10 April 2006 with a French tour to promote it.\n\nAt the beginning of 2007 Plain and his old friend Casino Steel agreed to form a new punk supergroup to play Ramones-influenced rock\u2019n\u2019roll with a hint of Dolly Parton.  The result was \u201cThe Last Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Band\u201d featuring Plain\u2019s Amigos Mat Sargent & Robbie Rushton alongside Petter Baarli (Backstreet Girls).  Their self titled debut album was released on October 7 2007.  Plain released his first acoustic album \u201cHonest John Plain Untuned\u201d on Still Unbeatable Records in Germany in 2009.\n\nIn the summer of 2011 Plain went into the iconic Rockfield Recording Studios in Monmouth, Wales to record a solo album for release in the fall of 2012.  Amongst others Plain recruited Glen Matlock (Sex Pistols), Martin Chambers (The Pretenders), Michael Monroe (Hanoi Rocks), Sami Yaffa (Hanoi Rocks & New York Dolls), Casino Steel (the Boys & Holton/Steel), Darrell Bath (The Crybabys & Dogs D\u2019Amour), Verden Allen (Mott The Hoople) and Die Toten Hosen.\n\nDuring December 2011 Plain embarked on a month long European tour showcasing his solo acoustic show.  The following month he teamed up with Italian band The Landslide Ladies for an Italian tour with a live album \u201cHonest Alive\u201d released on 10  June 2012.\n\nIn July 2012 Plain recorded a video for his single \u201cNever Listen To Rumours\u201d with acclaimed director Tony Klinger (The Kids Are Alright, Deep Purple Rises Over Japan). Michael Monroe, Sami Yaffa, Casino Steel, Martin Chambers, Verden Allen & Darrell Bath all flew in from around the world to appear in the video.\n\nHe toured Europe again with The Landslide Ladies in 2013 as well as performing numerous solo acoustic shows.\n\nThe Boys have just finished recording their first album since 1981\u2019s \u201cBoys Only\u201d and it is set to be released in 2014.

Our event offers a full day packed full of activities and features that deliver the best and most accessible way to enjoy a Turkish cultural experience outside of Turkey.  \n\nFrom live performances by leading Turkish artists and musicians to  recreations of Turkeys greatest landmarks, visitors can enjoy a complimenting mixture of modernity and tradition in a quintessentially British location with a distinctly Turkish atmosphere.'\n\nThis year, UK & Turkey Events set out to organise \u201cTurkish Day In London\u201d in Trafalgar Square, exposing Turkish culture to the masses with an event that was to be the first of its kind in the United Kingdom and on a massive scale.\n\nOur vision was to exhibit the diverse colours and vibrancy of the Turkish community in London whilst engaging with Londoners. Indeed, Turkish Day In London had the full support of the Turkish community of London along with many Anglo-Turkish institutions, the Turkish Embassy, Consulate and Chamber Of Commerce among them.\n\nWe have received feedback from our fans on Facebook and our community and discovered that there was a significant preference for Turkish Day In London to be held in either Spring or Summer rather than in November 2013. We appreciate that the British winter doesn't do a Turkish celebration justice!\n\nTherefore we have decided to postpone the event to take place on the 17th May 2014, taking advantage of the beautiful British summer weather.\n\nWe appreciate that the postponement will be met by disappointment by some, but we are committed to holding a fantastic family-friendly Turkish Day In London and will continue as always to welcome the support of our community here in London. \n\nWatch this space!",

Besides creating catchy psychedelic 60/70\u2019s-hooks spiced up with stoner, blues and rock&roll influences, this threesome is also master in invoking a primal emotion that lays hidden in many of us. The kind of emotion that craves to burst out when you experience something true, something real. Well, these guys are it, they ARE the real deal: sex, drugs and rock&roll! Blood, sweat and\u2026 ah, mostly alcohol!\n \nNew Album: Early November the band finished recordings for their second official album. JORIS WOLFF is behind the knobs (e.g. De Staat, Within Temptation and Mister and Mississippi) and mastering is done by BRIAN LUCEY (e.g. The Black Keys, Artic Monkeys, David Lynch and Dr. John).\n \nRelease Dates: For the new album BOJ signed a worldwide deal with LONG BRANCH RECORDS (e.g. Everlast, Prong and Chimaira), a label from SPV GmbH. For France and Japan the band signed with MODULOR/GRAND PALAIS, and SUBURBAN RECORDS takes care of the Benelux. The new album will be released in Benelux on February 1st and in all other countries in March.\n \nEuropean Tour: Birth Of Joy starts 2014 with 2 shows at EUROSONIC NOORDERSLAG and goes on to do an extensive European clubtour from February to May. In February the band plays Dutch and Belgian venues, in March USA, UK and Switserland will be visited, in April France and Germany and in May Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland.

All dates will be announced asap!\n \nwww.birthofjoy.com\nwww.longbranchrecords.com\nwww.moduledistribution.com\nwww.suburban.nl\n\nNightworkers \n\"These guys know what rock 'n' roll is. Mixing 60s psychedelia and English swagger, the band who could rock n' roll-wise be the cousin of The Small Faces (yes, really) offered ten songs to an audience who realised they were living some kind of historical musical moment\" - High & Loud\n \nBlackBoxRed\n\"This is one boy/girl duo who aren't dealing in cute and cuddly lo-fi. Fast, furious, and possessing more attitude in their smudged eyeliner than should be legal.\"\n\nTickets are also available from\nGigantic Tickets - http://bit.ly/1eQXMet\nand \nSEE Tickets - http://bit.ly/1lvI2z4",

This event is a celebration of 50 years of Mod not from its mysterious birth but when it swept across the whole of Britain. Since then it has reinvented itself time and time again to each new generation in keeping with the spirit of its pioneers and originators.\n\nThe four day event over the Easter Holidays 2014 will showcase all aspects of Mod music and culture spanning the last six decades. The Mod scene is now truly global as this event proved ten years ago when artists and disciples from all over the World descended on London for \u2018Modstock 2 - 40 Years Of Mod \n\nThe whole festival will be filmed for a future DVD release and TV documentary so make sure you are part of this historical event!",

With a firm focus on high quality production and mould-busting ideas, the label has helped break artists such as Hot Since 82 and Mia Dora, as well as pushing established powerhouses such as Eats Everything, Danny Daze and Groove Armada. Alongside monthly EP releases, the annual Moda Black albums have received widespread acclaim, whilst the tail end of 2013 saw the launch of their new artist-lead project Little Black Book. In short, Moda Black is firing on all cylinders and 2014 looks set to be their biggest year yet. \n\nAfter a stack of roadblock London parties, the Moda Black boys will be back in the capital this March, for a one-night-only affair at the formidable Village Underground. To ensure maximum perspiration, J&AG have combined forces with Purp & Soul frontman Ben Pearce, MadTech's tag-team champions No Artificial Colours, and rising Moda Black star, and all-round groove connoisseur, Hauswerks. No ass will remain unshaken! \n\nVillage Underground, 54 Holywell Lane, Shoreditch, London, EC2A 3PQ\nOpen from 10.00pm \u2013 4.00am\nFully licensed bar until close\nNearest Tube: Old Street (Northern Line) / Liverpool Street (Hammersmith & City / Metropolitan / Circle Lines)",

        "description": "As in life, music has a way to move you, shake you, bring you up and make you dance. This is London Calling, the all new Monthly event to be hosted at the amazing UNION. We will not only have America's best but Artist's from around the world. Our goal is simple: to provide a VIBE to dance and enjoy all night long. Our mission is to expand the ever growing sound of Garage, UK House and 2 Step Genre's. What we as a collective of artist's have decided is to put focus on the music and the Vibe. Just for fun we will be doing Live Broadcast's at each and every London Calling from 12-2 AM with one of our partners so those that can not make the show can dance at home or work. \n\nTHIS MONTH WE FEATURE ONE OF THE WORLDS BEST: \n\n*********** DOORLY - LONDON *****************\n              www.soundcloud.com/doorly\n                www.twitter.com/doorlydj\n               www.facebook.com/doorlydj\n\nTOOLROOM, FOOD MUSIC, IBIZA ROCKS , RINSEFM \n\n    Producer, DJ, Radio Presenter, Promoter...... Musical polymath, Doorly seems to have already ticked off a lot of the things on any DJ's Bucket List.  Djing in Time Square New York, Touring regularly alongside his Hero & Inspiration in Fatboy Slim, Recording TWO BBC Radio 1 Essential Mixes, Producing and DJing Live for Usher & Nicki Minaj, and sharing the stage with the Prodigy to 65,000 people (Twice!).\n\n    Over the next 5 Years Doorly went on to do a series of musically versatile remixes for Acts including Kanye West, The Prodigy, Dizzee Rascal, Basement Jaxx, Play right across the world at all the major festivals and Become a Resident & Stage Host for Ibiza Weekly stalwart Ibiza Rocks. Also Doorly would find himself in the studio with another inspiration of his in Grandmaster Flash working on music together.\n\nNow a UK export, Doorly relocated to Los Angeles, California at the end of 2012 and has been busy and rapidly rising Stateside over the winter, creating an array of huge parties ranging from sunshine house and disco gatherings on the rooftops of Austin at SXSW with his UK crew Skream, Toddla T and Jackmaster, to headlining 2000 capacity \u2018secret\u2019 warehouse parties in Downtown LA , As well as simultaneously programming and co-ordinating his events back in the UK & Ibiza in the meantime.\n \nDoorly's Los Angeles \u2018Boom Boom Room\u2019 Studios are now fully up and running and he has been working hard honing and fine tuning a more streamlined 4x4 Sound. Early 2013 saw the release of nostalgia evoking \u2018new school\u2019 piano house track \u201cRush\u201d on Diplo's LA based mega label \u201cMad Decent\u201d. \u201cRush\u201d went also down a storm in the UK, gaining full sweeping support from Radio 1\u2019s first lady Annie Mac and some of the biggest in the game prompting a new signing and worldwide re-release by Mark Knight's Toolroom records over the summer alongside a host of new more underground House tracks on his Boom Boom Room EP series 1 & 2 which have gained love from Richie Hawtin, Loco Dice, Pete Tong & Fatboy Slim, Cajmere, Justin Martin, Huxley & Groove Armada to name a few.  On the second EP his tracks \u201cI want you to dance\u201d & \u201cCant Stop The Feeling\u201d once again had widespread Radio 1 Love from Annie Mac & Tong but also sat pretty in and around the top 10 Beatport Deep House chart for over a month.\n\nAlongside a fresh arsenal of original tracks now set for release across the summer, Doorly was honoured to be asked to officially remix Armand Van Helden\u2019s ultimate dance classic \u2018You Don\u2019t Know Me\u2019 and also the Seminal Steve Silk Hurley record - Jack Your Body, a track that gained full support from Claude Vonstroke, Seth Troxler, Skream, Eats Everything, Justin Martin, Catz & Dogz and was release through Steve silk\u2019s S&S records in conjunction with Toolroom.  And has just Officially remixed Claude Vonstroke\u2019s \u201cThe Clapping Track\u201d due for release on Dirtybird in April.\n\n \nBesides his solo production work, Doorly this summer  released the first track \u201cDissapearer\u201d (featuring Scissor Sister Jake Shears) Via his new collaboration project \u2018AVEC\u201d which he has formed with close friend Simon Bird (Dave Spoon/ Shadow Child).  AVEC are set to release a host of fun and fresh house music through Southern Fried Records featuring some amazing guest artists. Doorly has a long standing relationship and love for Southern Fried and recently mixed the latest \u2018Southern Fried & Tested\u2019 compilation in July and is currently mixing the next Toolroom Knights Compilation due out in May.\n\nThis year will mark Doorly\u2019s seventh season on the White Isle of Ibiza (his second home) and his continued love and commitment to the islands parties is apparent in his extensive gig schedule with almost 60 dates played in the Balearics already booked in for this summer. Including dates at the iconic \u201cWe Love Sundays\u201d parties at Space and of course a return to his Ibiza family at Ibiza Rocks for both their Wednesday and Friday W.A.R (We Are Rockstars) Shows as DJ & Stage Host as well as a nice scattering of other parties across the island.  Also new for 2013 we saw the launch of the \u201cDoorly and Friends\u201d boat parties which ran weekly on Fridays with some of the hottest line ups ever to be seen at sea!\n\nDoorly\u2019s dedication to the craft of DJing remains paramount, with sets being played out across four CDJs, plus a samplers / FX units he is a firm believer that a DJ set should be a live turntablism experience. Doorly continues to work alongside Pioneer as one of its Pro-DJ Ambassadors and is directly involved with testing, design and training with Pioneer DJ equipment together with fellow DJ witches James Zabiela, Zane Lowe, Eats Everything and Laidback Luke.\n\n \n\nw/ SUPPORTING SELECTA'S \n\nDELL HARRIS - ATLANTA \nwww.facebook.com/dellharrismusic\n\nSORTED - ATLANTA \nwww.facebook.com/djsortedatl\n\nMARK YURM - ATLANTA \nwww.facebook.com/BecuaseAtl\n\nRALPH & LOUIE - ATLANTA \nwww.facebook.com/RALPH.LOUIE.FAN\n\nMERRICK - ATLANTA \n\nSEBASTIAN MURCIA & TITO - ATLANTA \nhttps://www.facebook.com/theimperialatl\n\nPRE SALES ARE NOW ON SALE - \n\n21+ ENTRY \n\nFREE JELLO SHOTS..",

The founder of private members club The Cuckoo Club and renowned for his wild experiences Tom Parker Bowles adds that \u201cNick has seen more dawns around the world than even the most dedicated of blackbirds. For the past 30 years, he\u2019s been a constant and ever-welcome presence on the nocturnal scene.\u201d\nNick has been a regular presence at all the hottest parties in town. His dominance of social soirees even defies the likes of Tamara Palmer-Tomkinson who says, \u201cWhen it comes to glamorous parties, I\u2019ve seen Nick out more times than I\u2019ve seen myself.\u201d\n\nAlso recent author to his first book entitled Clubs, Drugs and Canap\u00e9s: A Deep Journey into the Shallows of the Night which involves an \u2018attempt to recall the last 35 years of partying\u2019.\n\nJoin the fun at the new party homestead of Nick Valentine\u2019s debauchery, every Friday. Expect nothing less than celebrity guests, the best of the West London crowd and great music provide by DJ Julian Jay Palomba at L\u2019etranger\u2019s members club, Meursault.",

This could not be achieved without the help of our resident's that have pitched in from day dot to make our parties happen.\n\nWith June being so far away our feet have started to itch so what better way to fill in the gap than to to throw a Resident's Party!!! \n\nFor this event we've invited our good friend's Curtis Lee from Lustrino & also Felix Abba & Jordan Diston from the Don't Get Lemon crew to come and pitch in with the fun. As always Output residents Kiddo and JJ will flying the flag and need no explanation for what they do. \n \nSpecial Guest... \n\nFlighting in from Kyoto, Japan and making his first appearance here in Birmingham we have Jun Akimoto, part of the FUSE London family, to close our party with an exclusive 2 hour set of deep dark dubby techno just the way we like it.\n\nThis is a very rare opportunity to see a true mastermind at work as he demonstrate his crazy skillz behind the turntables, unleashing some of the most exclusive underground music on the circuit to date.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/jun-akimoto \n\nThis will be an intense night of music not for the faint hearted but as always set within a friendly laid back environment.

        "description": "Cloud9 are proud to present our opening night at the Garage, London. Giving you the best in the deep and soulful House music through out the night, provided by the leading DJ's form the U.K and worldwide.\n\nDJ SPEN \n\nSpen began his career at the age of 13, producing mix shows for WEBB AM in Baltimore. Even at that young age, Spen founded one of the area's first hip hop production groups, the Numarx. In 1986 they wrote and recorded a track called \"Girl You Know It's True\", which was later covered and made famous by Milli Vanilli.\n\nSpen's radio career continued to grow and lead him to a radio career working at various FM radio stations in the Baltimore and Washington areas. In 1992, Spen developed a mixshow on 95.9 FM in Baltimore called the Flashback Saturday Night Dance Party. Though Spen eventually moved on from radio, the show is still a hit today, with Spen's close friend KW Griff at the helm.\n\nSpen's production talents lead him to Basement Boys Records in 1989. With the formation of The Basement Boys record label in 1994, Spen formed Jasper Street Company, and released his first full production, A Feelin. With the Basement Boys and Jasper Street, Spen gained consistent commercial and dancefloor success, and became an in-demand remix producer. He has created remixes for some of clubland's biggest names, such as Diana Ross, Everything but the Girl, Ann Nesby, and Shaun Escoffery. While at Basement Boys, Spen partnered with Teddy Douglas, Thommy Davis and Karizma to create works that are still considered house anthems.\n\nHaving reached his full potential with Basement Boys, Spen stepped out on his own and partnered with Gary Deane to form the Code Red Record label in January 2004. He hasn't stopped moving since! Spen is still producing and making records that are sure to become legend. Spen's new venture found him back with former partners Thommy Davis and Karizma creating the successful Voodoo Ray, Nightrain and 4 the Love. Not long after the formation of Code Red, Gary Hudgins and Irvin Madden, key musicians and writers from Basement Boys days, joined Spen and Gary Deane to form a new production team called the MuthaFunkaz whose first release, \"The Best I Can\" shows a new side of Spen. The Muthafunkaz soon added soulful vocalist Marc Evans to the group. Code Red joined Defected Records for a partnership that would see the release of one of their earliest successes. \u201cThe Way You Love Me\u201d, featuring Marc Evans, has gained worldwide attention and become a soulful house anthem. In 2008, the MuthaFunkaz completed production of Marc Evans' full length LP. In addition to the original group, the MuthaFunkaz now includes vocalist Sheila Ford, vocalist Biblical Jones (formerly of Jasper Street Company), drummer Robert Wright, horn player Eric Marner, and vocalist Erin Madden. In October 2010 Code Red will release the MuthaFunkaz LP entitled \"The MuthaLode\". The first single, \"A Reason to Love\" has been released and is already burning up dance floors all over the world. True to his roots, Spen formed the Spiritually Sound label, which will be sure to give Spen fans more of the gospel and inspirational house music Spen has become famous for.\n\nWith a career span of more than 20 years and his famous studio and production work, Spen has become one of the most sought-after DJs in the U.S. Spen can be found jetting off to gigs at some of the premier clubs around the world. He plays regularly in the UK, as well as France, Italy, Japan, and Australia.\n\nAlso In the main room we are excited to have U.K House and Disco legend, JOEY NEGRO who is the most well-known pseudonym of master British DJ/producer/remixer Dave Lee. Under a plethora of other monikers including Jakatta, Akabu, Doug Willis, Raven Maize, The Sunburst Band, Sessomatto, and Z Factor, Dave was one of the first artists to incorporate disco samples in house music when he began his production career in 1988. Indeed, he was in the studio making credible and outstanding British House music when many luminaries around him were still busy getting to grips with their decks. Little has changed since then and Dave is still widely regarded as one of the most commercially successful and in-demand artists on the global scene.\n\nWith full support from Rhemi, who have taken the soulful House scene by storm in the last year. Producing top quality music, and working with artist such the likes of Quentin Harris and Lynn Lockamy as well running their own Rhemi Music imprint. Soul heaven / Groove Fest resident Sy Sez will be warming proceedings up on the night to get your dancing feet going for what is going to be a amazing night of music!!\n\nIf this wasn't enough already, we have a very special Dj/Producer flying in from Balitmore,USA for an exclusive performance on the night. Full details will be announced on 30th of March.\n\nUpstairs we take things a little deeper with some of London's most renowned underground Dj's in the form of Rap Saunders from the legendary London night Soulmates, Jamesey from Making Moves,Leon Paul of Nyumba Deep and last but not least Shaun Ashby and Joshua Allen from Fused Records.\n\n.............................................................................................\nMain Room\nSoulful House\n\nDJ SPEN (Baltimore,USA)\nJOEY NEGRO\nRHEMI\n(Neil Pierce & Ziggy Funk)\nSY SEZ\n\nRoom 2 \nAfro/Deep House\n\nRap Saunders (soulmates)\nJamsey (Making Moves)\nLeon Paul (Nyumba Deep)\nShaun Ashby  & Joshua Allen (Fused Records)\n\n10PM \u2013 4AM\nTHE GARAGE \n20-22 Highbury Crescent\nLondon N5 1RD\n\nOTD:  \u00a315\nTICKETS: \u00a310/\u00a312 \nTICKETS AVAILABLE FROM\n\nhttp://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?574715\n\nIN STORE: \n\nZee & Co Ilford Branch\n4-6 Cranbrook Rd,\nIlford \nIG1 4DJ\nPhone: 020 8514 1617\n\nZee & Co Angel Branch\n36 Upper Street, \nIslington\nLondon,\nN1 0PN\nPhone: 020 7354 5855",

        "description": "Hi all,\n\nAs many of you already know, on Sunday 13th April (next weekend) I'll be running the London Marathon.\n\nTraining started back in November and was all going swimmingly until 8 weeks ago when I picked up a knee injury.\n\nI've managed to fumble my way through training over these final 8 weeks and I'm pleased to say that I'll still be lining up at the start line. My ability to achieve the time I want has probably gone but I'm determined to get around the 26.2 mile course regardless.\n\nI'm raising money for Asthma UK so if you'd like to sponsor me for this gruelling challenge you can do so at the following link:\n\nhttp://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/MarkMayor\n\nAlternatively, if you'd prefer to do it the old fashioned way with a pen & paper I have a sponsorship form so just get in touch with me and we can sort it out.\n\nThe London Marathon is always one of the best days out in London and this year it doesn't look like being any different with Mo Farah running his first marathon and the weather currently forecast at 15 degrees and sunny. It'd be great to see as many of you there as possible whether you're supporting or abusing me. The below attachment takes you to a Spectators Guide showing you the route. It also gives some more info about each section of the course as well as the pubs en route.\n\nhttp://static.london-marathon.co.uk/uploads/marathon-centre/2014-online-spec-guide.pdf\n\nI'm heading to the expo on Thursday to pick up my number etc so let me know if you intend to come and watch on Sunday and I'll pick up a route map and drop it over to you. I'll also make up a little pace guide so you'll have a good idea of the exact time that I'll be passing each mile marker. On race day the London Marathon website will also have a tracker button meaning you'll be able to see my progress. If you do come along on the day, the best thing to do will be to text me where you are on the course (between miles x & y) and what side of the road you will be on to me. That way I'll be able to work my way over towards that side of the road to give you the best chance of spotting me and me seeing you!\n\nI'm thinking about heading for a celebratory drink in and around Fenchurch St after I've finished so would be great to see you and thank you for your support. Let me know if you're interested in doing that and I'll arrange something.\n\nIf you have any questions don't hesitate in firing them across to me. Thanks for all of your support!!\n\nMuch love,\n\nMark/Biscuit/MJ\nxx",

He's promoted some of London's biggest parties, and played some of the world's biggest. Steven joined us as our new resident in January 2013 to play a great underground tech house set.\nhttp://www.mixcloud.com/WRONG_Club/steven-sharp-at-wrong-17-august-2013/\n\n\nJAMIE DE ROOY\nJamie de Rooy has for the past few years been bringing the London sound to Spain through his twice-weekly peak-hour mix show through Barcelona's premier dance music radio station, Styl FM. Jamie's supercharged tech house sets rock WRONG's parties, and will bring you up and then keep you on a peak til you can't dance anymore.\nhttp://www.mixcloud.com/jamiederooy/\n\nTHOMAS WONDERLAND\nThomas is Wrong's Corsican import, and he's been partying since he was 13. Ibiza, Spain, London, France, Thailand, Goa - his travels have informed his music. WRONG! was one of the first club nights Thomas played, and we're delighted to have secured him as one of our forward-thinking residents.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/thomas-wonderland\n\nENRICO CHIRCHIELLO\nEnrico was born in Montreal, Canada in 1992 and moved to Italy at the age of 7. As a young boy he was already passionate about music and by the age of 13 he started DJing with turntables in small local clubs. Enrico has always been influeced and inspired by South American sounds. The style of music he DJs is predominantly Techno House. In 2011 he, with close friend Luca Donofrio, created a dual-owned record label called Mad System Brothers. That same year the two decided to move to London, for better opportunities, to meet new people and play in big clubs. In his endeavour to promote his DJing style and music, he has been resident at, and played in, a number of clubs in London. As his latest venture, Enrico has created and run his own events organisation called Last Drop, where he involves guest DJs and invites friends for a night of good music with a great ambiance. He has released tracks on labels like: Mr Ambrose Recordings, Finish Team Record, Housebeat Record, Black Eye Records, Jintonik Records, WOD Limited, Code2 Records, Beach Music Records, Celestial Recordings.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/enrico-chirchiello",

Taking place at the subterranean hideout that is Vauxhall\u2019s Fire & Lightbox, Bedrock will showcase three rooms of house and techno. With some of the scenes most exciting players showcased in the Capital over the past fifteen years, Bedrock will again leave no stone unturned and deliver a forward-thinking line-up which encapsulates a wide spectrum of sounds.\n\nAt Easter Bedrock John Digweed will deliver another timeless journey through his trademark beats via an extended six hour main room set alongside some very special guests. This bespoke collection of artists are either signed to Bedrock Records or long time favourites of John and all will reflect the imprints underground ethos. This will be John\u2019s second visit to the Capital this year following the sold out Village Underground event. His headline performance at Bedrock is the ideal platform through which to see this master at work and is certainly not to be missed.\n\nAs one of house music\u2019s finest producers, we are delighted to welcome Ripperton to Bedrock for the very first time. Firmly established as a true ambassador of dark and melodic beats, Ripperton\u2019s most recent studio output has been in the form of his second album \u2018A Little Part Of Shade\u2019, three track EP \u201877\u2019 and a Robert Babicz remix. The immersive techno and refined house prevalent in these productions have proven hugely popular in his sets at Europe\u2019s seminal nightclubs and it\u2019s with great excitement that we look forward to Ripperton\u2019s Bedrock debut.  \n\nIn the Lightbox Bedrock welcomes one of the most sought after female DJs currently residing on the house circuit, the magnificent Kim Ann-Foxman. Having built a globetrotting schedule from her own DJ and production pursuits, Kim can be found touring the world\u2019s finest clubs and festivals. Her sound boasts intense and chunky grooves placed on top of raw and directive basslines as evident in her recent collaborations with Maya Jane Coles and KiNK. Having delivered standout performances at The Warehouse Project and Fabric, we welcome the Big Apple\u2019s finest to Bedrock as she intoxicates the Lightbox with her infectious sounds.\n\nKim will be joined by one of electronic music\u2019s hottest prospects, Harvey Mckay. Harvey is a name that has continued to rise thanks to a reputation for one-off originals, killer remixes and energetic DJ sets. His powerful productions have been released on labels including Drumcode, Bedrock, Soma, Saved and Cocoon, with his \u2018Lost\u2019 EP continuing to dominate Beatport\u2019s techno chart three months after its release. With his new EP \u2018Illusion of Control\u2019 set to have a similar impact, Harvey\u2019s debut performance at Bedrock is set to be a true highlight on Thursday 17th April.\n\nAs one of the most influential figures dance music has ever seen, Darren Emerson\u2019s history has been well documented; a former member of Underworld and producer of one of the greatest tracks ever in 'Born Slippy', he also captured the public\u2019s imaginations with dancefloor anthem 'Scorchio' (with Sasha) plus unforgettable remixes for The Chemical Brothers and Bj\u00f6rk. More recently, Emerson\u2019s debut Bedrock release \u2018Hotdog\u2019 and EP on Hotflush (as \u2018The White Lamp\u2019) has caused huge waves. Joining us off the back of a Japanese Tour as well as performances in India, Australia and Argentina, Bedrock please welcome Darren Emerson. \n\nAlso playing the Lightbox following his outstanding performance at the fifteenth anniversary party, is one of 2013\u2019s breakthrough artists Eagles & Butterflies. Since emerging onto the scene, E&B has come a long way in establishing himself. Having gained significant interest by spinning at Space Ibiza\u2019s Clandestin party throughout last summer, Eagles & Butterflies\u2019 latest studio offering, the \u2018SYW003\u2019 EP will be released on his own imprint, Spread Your Wings. Joining us ahead of the release of his debut artist album, \u2018The Butterfly Effect\u2019, Eagles & Butterflies completes the Lightbox lineup brilliantly, thanks to his forward-thinking track selection and superb technical ability. \n\nElusive Bristol based producer Dubspeeka, who recently debuted on Oliver Huntemann's Ideal Audio label, headlines the Protocol room hosted by Subculture. Having impressed with an array of releases over the past twelve months, on labels such as Bedrock, Truesoul, Hope and on his very own Skeleton imprint, he's now focussed on exploring the full spectrum of electronic music under his Dubspeeka alias. Exciting many of the underground's elite over the last year with his distinctive sound, his tunes are driven by the heaviest of basslines and kick-drums, plus a dark and industrial edge.\n\nCompleting the bill for Bedrock\u2019s Easter showcase is Blue Amazon. His direct approach to mixing allows him to dive deep into the realms of tech house and techno to energize and stimulate the crowd. Blue Amazon\u2019s performances are always seamless, building dynamically from melodic basslines to high-energy techno beats. Having originally developed from his hip-hop based roots, Blue Amazon\u2019s technical ability to manipulate effects, loops and everything in between is second to none and has been evident in his previous sets alongside the likes of John Digweed, Sasha and Danny Howells to name a few.\n\nFire, South Lambeth Road, London, SW8 1RT\nOpen from 10.00pm \u2013 7.00am\nFully licensed bar until close\nNearest Tube: Vauxhall (Victoria Line)",

        "description": "Day Drunk is competing in CBC's Searchlight Contest with the chance to win 20,000$ and a festival gig! Please help support us by voting every day and getting others to vote as well.\n\nVOTE HERE: http://music.cbc.ca/artists/Day-Drunk\n\nVoting for Regional Top 25 takes place March 24th-April 6th 3PM\n\nVoting for Regional Top 10 runs April 7th-13th\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \"We've chosen the song The Stories We Will Tell  for CBC's Searchlight not only because of it's original meaning but because it's meaning grows with the ever growing story of our lives. The song was written telling the story of my housemates who helped me through a lot, and are closer to me than brothers. The narrative that is told throughout the song are real events from my life that I hold dear. The opening line \"I watch the stars with a million other people\" is inspired by a tattoo my housemate has. The tattoo was meant as a reminder that no matter where he is, he is always looking at the same night sky as his loved ones, which would help bring comfort on long outdoor trips. This was a sentiment shared with him by his father, which inspired him to get the tattoo. I use the line to express that even though one day when we all are off living our separate lives, we can always be brought back together by looking up at the stars. One night in particular he was outside looking up at the stars, and myself and the other housemates came out to join him. We talked of our friendship and about how one day, it'll be these moments, these stories, that we will share of each other to our children.\n\n\nI could come home after the shittiest of days and within minutes of being home, I would feel like everything would be alright. The fact that I landed in a house with these guys was entirely by happenstance, which inspired the line that the pieces just seem to have fallen into place.\n\nThe bridge is meant as a toast to life, and living it to the fullest and not being afraid to give love. I've lost friends to suicide, and to think that they didn't know the love I had for them is a mistake I never want to have happen again. Love is indeed worth giving and life is worth living, if only for the precious moments we share with even more precious people.\n\nThey say these are the best years of our lives and I believe it, and knowing I can look up at the night sky and be back in these moments with such wonderful people, I know I'll never have to truly say farewell.\n\nBut as I said before, the song's meaning grows with every new story. The story of the band coming together itself was really random as well. I saw a poster for McMaster's Last Band Standing, and figured since I'd always wanted to do something like that, that I should go for it. Marty was an acquaintance who was a friend of my housemates. Rhett was his housemate and joined the band once we jammed with him. Now I couldn't ask for two better friends to be sharing the stage with, and doing what we love to do, playing music. We recently competed in LCBO's Whiskey Rocks and got to open for Theory of a Deadman, which was unreal, but the most incredible thing was getting to rock out on that stage and just have fun with two great buddies. Our main band photo is actually from that show, and we decided that Stories would be one of our songs for that set because that moment would in fact be a story we would tell. The photo was taken perfectly fittingly during the bridge, which as I said is a toast to life, we asked the audience to toast with us and the crowd of two thousand people toasted with us.\n\nWe're so grateful to our unbelievable friends, families and fans who have really gotten our music out there and have given us huge opportunities like that.\n\nWe've only been a band for just over a year but are already getting airplay around college radio, with our debut EP charting on CFMU's Chart Top 30 for 7 weeks, peaking at #4. \n\nLastly, what I find so wonderful is that everyone has stories they will tell, of the moments and the people that have impacted their lives, and I hope that this song inspires people to think of those memories.\"\n\n- Jordan Hallin",

After sell out shows there with Nina Kraviz last Spring and Levon Vincent this NYE, they come with a typically heritage-meets-cutting-edge line-up that makes it a must go to event for any discerning house and techno fan alike.\n\nHeadlining the event is none other than Derrick May, Detroit innovator and famously part of the Belleville 3 alongside Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson. Spanning a career of decades and responsible for various classic productions along the way, Derrick is now most renowned for his prowess as a DJ and is a man still very much at the top of his game. Effortlessly combining a raw funk backbone with a smoother more hypnotic sensibility, his set for secretsundaze last year at the Opening Party at Studio 338 was the highlight of our summer so we cant wait to welcome him back, but this time, presenting him in a different scenario, as we witness the damage he can do in a packed theatre house with disco lights.\n\nCo-headlining is Swiss veteran Deetron, whose skills as both a producer and as a technically genius 3-turntable DJ, has earned him a unique position in the world of house and techno, fiercely independent, and not aligned to any particular crew or label. His stock has steadily risen and now, whilst inspiring a new generation of young artists along the way, is one of the most in-demand DJs out there. These skills can be heard on his highly rated Balance CD compilation and most recently his natural flair in the studio 'Music Over Matter', his second artist album. Many of Deetron's roots are in Detroit techno so he was our first choice to pair alongside Derrick May for an enticing US / European meeting of minds..\n\nAs a 3rd guest in the main room we welcome rising star, Argentinian but London based Arnaldo, who has steadily been carving a reputation as one of a new wave of serious deep house artists emerging from the city. Playing only the coolest spots and often publishing his long live sets online to much acclaim from the heads, he is also more than handy in the studio, recording for esteemed labels such as Lawrence's Smallville and Blank Slate no less.\n\nAs ever, secretsundaze founders James Priestley and Giles Smith will be on residential duties, warming up and rounding off proceedings as only they know how.\n\nTaking over Room 2 is one of favourite labels right now, Bristol based Livity Sound. The union of artists Peverelist, Kowton & Asusu is releasing some of the most forward thinking music out there, taking inspiration from dub, jungle and crucially techno. They are at the forefront of a new wave of UK labels exploring these crossroads. The results are formidable, rightfully earning them the highly respected accolade of Top Label of 2013 on Resident Advisor. Their string of vinyl only releases have been charted by some of the world's most adventurous DJs, but it was the Livity Sound CD compilation that has transcended them onto the lips of any UK electronic music lover worth their salt.\n\nEarly bird tickets are now on sale exclusively through Resident Advisor.",

So what more fitting place could there be to host a series of thirty-two talks on some of the men and women who helped make London one of the world's pre-eminent cities? \n\nOn May 1st 2014 the London Eye will be set to a special slow rotation speed and each of its 32 capsules will be given over to a talk by a well-known authority on a famous Londoner. The subjects will range from Thomas Becket to Joseph Bazalgette, from WS Gilbert to Ray Davies and from Queen Victoria to Zadie Smith. The lecturers themselves will be a roll call of those who have contributed to the capital's cultural legacy: from former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone, to ex-Poet Laureate Andrew Motion, film director Julien Temple, broadcaster Robert Elms and biographers Claire Tomalin and Kate Williams. \n\nAs you soar high over two thousand years of London's history in the hands of our expert guides what better insight could you have into the lives and works of the influential figures who have shaped the heritage, culture and image of our ancient and celebrated capital? \n\nTo commemorate the occasion Hendrick's Gin have devised 32 bespoke cocktails, one in honour of each London borough. Each guest will be served a complimentary cocktail of their choice during the lecture. After disembarkation there will be an opportunity to share a drink with your fellow participants and speakers and discuss this singular and inspirational event. \n\n32 Londoners has been curated by a Curious Invitation and Antique Beat as a unique experience intended to strengthen the cultural connection of Londoners with the city in which they live and work.\n\nTHE TALKS\n\nAnne Duggan on THOMAS BECKET - Saint, b. 1118 Cheapside\nHenry Eliot on GEOFFREY CHAUCER - Poet, b.1343 London\nDan Cruickshank on JOHN STOW - Historian, b. 1525 Cornhill\nClaire Tomalin on SAMUEL PEPYS - Diarist, b. 1633 Fleet Street\nMartin Rowson on WILLIAM HOGARTH - Satirist, b. 1697 Clerkenwell\nIan Kelly on BEAU BRUMMELL - Dandy, b. 1778 St James\nMatt Brown on MICHAEL FARADAY - Scientist, b. 1791 Southwark\nSir Andrew Motion on JOHN KEATS - Poet, b. 1795 Moorgate\nKate Williams on QUEEN VICTORIA - Monarch, b. 1819 Kensington\nStephen Halliday on JOSEPH BAZALGETTE - Engineer, b. 1819 Enfield\nMartin Lamb on WS GILBERT - Composer, b. 1836 The Strand\nEssie Fox on MARIE LLOYD - Singer, b. 1870 Hoxton\nGeoffrey Beare on WILLIAM HEATH ROBINSON - Cartoonist, b. 1872 Finsbury Park\nCharles Elford on SAMUEL COLERIDGE-TAYLOR - Composer, b. 1875 Holborn\nKen Livingstone on HERBERT MORRISON - Politician, b. 1888 Stockwell\nBryony Dixon on CHARLIE CHAPLIN - Actor, b. 1889 Walworth\nNathalie Morris on ALFRED HITCHCOCK - Film Director, b. 1899 Leytonstone\nD J Taylor on EVELYN WAUGH - Writer, b. 1903 West Hampstead\nHugo Vickers on CECIL BEATON - Photographer, b. 1904 Hampstead\nPeter Berthoud on PHYLIS PEARSALL - Inventor of the A-Z, b. 1906 East Dulwich\nJude Kelly on JOAN LITTLEWOOD - Theatre director, b. 1914 Stockwell\nDavid Stafford on LIONEL BART - Composer, b. 1930 Stepney\nKate Kray on THE KRAYS - Gangsters, b. 1933 Hoxton\nRobert Elms on ADAM FAITH - Pop Star, b. 1940 Acton\nGrant Fleming on BOBBY MOORE - Footballer, b. 1941 Barking\nJulien Temple on RAY DAVIES - Musician, b. 1944 Muswell Hill\nGeoffrey Marsh on DAVID BOWIE - Musician, b. 1947 Brixton\nDJ Nihal on JAZZIE B - Music producer, b. 1963 Hornsey\nGavin Evans on LENNOX LEWIS - Boxer, b. 1965 West Ham\nJacqueline Shaw on OZWALD BOATENG - Fashion designer, b. 1967 Muswell Hill\nLesley-Ann Jones on NAOMI CAMPBELL - Model, b. 1970 Streatham\nPhilippa Thomas on ZADIE SMITH - Writer, b. 1975 Brent\nEach ticket includes a complimentary Hendrick's Gin cocktail with a unique recipe for each of London's 32 boroughs and admission to the exclusive Featherless Flight Lounge in Jubilee Gardens next to County Hall.",

        "description": "Hi, thanks for visiting my fundraising page. \n\nTo Donate: http://www.virginmoneygiving.com/NathanViva\n\nA few years ago after a particularly hard time for me, I made a bucket list. On that list were many things... some I have managed to do, others that are in the pipeline and some that are still just items on a list. But one of the top ones was running the London Marathon. It took me 2 years of applying and even then I just got in with only 11 weeks to go as a back up. So here I am, kinda unprepared for it all, but determined to give it my best shot. \n\nTo let you know why you should sponsor me it might help to let you know how much of a challenge this actually is for me... Well, I have been running to keep fit as part of my kickboxing fight training for a few years now (another thing on my bucket list...) but I have never run anything further than 15km, I usually run around 5km. The Marathon is 42km. Marathon training normally requires a 24 week build up and intensive training, I have 11 weeks and haven\u2019t run AT ALL in the previous 3months. So, as you can see... this is going to be a challenge.\n\nWhy have I chosen The Royal British Legion and why do I think that you should want to donate to them, via me? A lot of people are just happy to take part and will run for anyone that needs people to run for them. I, however, specifically chose the British Legion as they are exactly the kind of charity that I love to support. They help real people, in real need. They are not a faceless research charity, but one that helps those who have laid their lives on the line to defend the country that you most likely call home. World War II veterans in need of care, support and to know that there are people out there that appreciate the sacrifices that they made for us. Its all too common that we forget those that were part of such a pivotal moment in our history. So, my targeted \u00a33000 will go towards wheelchairs, home care, medicine and vital care equipment to make their lives comfortable when they most need it. I am sure this now sounds like something you can feel comfortable donating towards, so for just the price of a pint (or hopefully more!) you can help. If you met some of the guys I am trying to help down the pub, and knew what they had been though for you all those years ago, you'd want to buy them a pint, wouldn\u2019t you? So, imagine that is what you are doing... if you can afford the price of a round, and a packet of cheese & onion with some pork scratchings on the side, then wicked!\n\nDon't forget to use the \"gift aid\" feature as they will give more on your behalf meaning that the target will be reached ever quicker, and more money will go to a good cause. Thank you and wish me luck!!\n\nThrough Virgin Money Giving, you can sponsor me and donations will be quickly processed and passed to charities. Virgin Money Giving is a not for profit organisation and will claim gift aid on a charity's behalf where the donor is eligible for this. I really appreciate all your support and thank you for any donations.\n\nTo Donate: http://www.virginmoneygiving.com/NathanViva",

Landing at a trio of the finest underground spots the UK has to offer, K\u00f6lsch has timed this tour to precede a series of high profile summer dates and forthcoming releases. Taking place on Thursday 10th April, the first date will welcome K\u00f6lsch to London\u2019s subterranean hideout Fire, for an intimate session of his much lauded live show. \n\nSince the release of his artistically brilliant album 1977 on Kompakt last June, the electronic world has been in admiration. Fittingly described as romantic techno, each of the thirteen tracks are melodic electronic anthems that leave the mind in state of euphoria. The end of the year saw K\u00f6lsch tour his beautifully crafted sound across Europe with dates in Belgium, Switzerland, Netherlands, France and Spain to name a few. Following this K\u00f6lsch opened 2014 in fine form by kicking off BBC Radio 1\u2019s Essential Mix Future Stars with a mix that set the precedent for rising artists taking part in the internationally acclaimed series. Having gained a vast amount of support from a plethora of the world\u2019s leading talent, it\u2019s clear that 2014 is the year of K\u00f6lsch. \n\nWith the next few months already shaping up nicely for the Dane, the rest of the tour will see him touch down in Manchester and Glasgow before taking on the mighty Amnesia Opening Party, Snowbombing and Mysteryland USA amongst others. With support coming from Electric Minds\u2019 Dolan Bergin, The Willers Brothers and Will Taylor do not miss this rare opportunity to experience K\u00f6lsch at his very best.\n\nFire, South Lambeth Road, London, SW8 1RT\nOpen from: 21:00 \u2013 01:00\nFull licenced bar until close\nNearest tube: Vauxhall (Victoria Line)",

        "description": "London Lunar Immersion with Jason Nemer & Erica Montes\n29th March to 2nd April 2014 at Triyoga Soho \n\nThe Lunar Immersion focuses on the healing, relaxing and rejuvenating practices of Thai massage and therapeutic flying. The Lunar Asana Sequence teaches basic body mechanics with a focus on self-love cultivation, in preparation for the dance of Thai massage. The techniques learned on the floor are then translated to the flying work, using the element of gravity to amplify the healing flow of prana (life force). Often, we will work in teams of three for safety and support, and everyone will have the opportunity to base and fly, heal and be healed. This training offers invaluable tools for yoga teachers, massage therapists, and energy workers who wish to develop a new dimension of healing touch for students or clients.\nSkills Covered:\n\u2022 Lunar Asana Sequence\n\u2022 Thai massage in Supine, Prone, Side Lying, & Seated positions\n\u2022 Forward, Backward & High Flying Whale Therapeutic Flying Sequences\n\nThe full 30 hours fulfils a prerequisite for AcroYoga Teacher Training.

Championed by Nirvana, Sonic Youth and hailed as a favourite by the cr\u00e8me-de-la-cr\u00e8me of Alternative Rock, Shonen Knife remain one of the most influential and beloved of Japanese rock exports.\nFollowing an extensive tour of Europe in 2013, the band return will for 15 dates across the UK and Ireland this May before heading to Europe, to promote the release of their 20th album, Overdrive.\nLive, they are a tight with machine-precision, punching out fast, highly exciting sets of Punk, Pop, Rock & Metal hits, all coated with their own distinctively quirky and life-affirming charm. As they fast approach their 1,000th gig, Shonen Knife's joy and invention shows no sign of fading. As Naoko says, \u201cLet's Rock!\u201d\n\n\n\"When I finally got to see them live, I was transformed into a hysterical nine-year-old girl at a Beatles concert.\" Kurt Cobain.\n\nPress :\nUncut: \"rocks like Motorhead designed by Hanna-Barbara\"\nBBC Music: \"The Osaka Ramones, you must concede, still have it.\"\nThe Independent: 8/10 \"There are two types of people: those who enjoy thrashy Japanese girl-punk, and those who have something wrong with them.\"\nMusic OMH: 8/10 \"For an incredible 31 years Shonen Knife have been pumping out prototype riot grrrl, thrashing together early punk sounds with pop melodies.\"\nThe Sunday Times: \".irrepressible slice of bounce-along indie-pop.

Objectivity can fuck right off, because Shonen Knife are brilliant\"\nThe Line Of Best Fit: 7/10 \"Robust in its eccentricities and musicianship, Pop Tune makes good on Yamano's assertion that the current Shonen Knife line-up is its strongest.\"\nThe Skinny: 8/10 \"Pop Tune is their most irresistible offering in years\"\nLouder Than War:\"As the world continues to go into economic meltdown we need the distraction of Shonen Knife more than ever - just allow yourself the simple pleasure of singing along.\"\nClash: \"Ultimately, without using superlatives, Shonen Knife should be set up for life as ambassadors for live music.\"\nBBC 6Music (Steve Lamacq):\"Shonen Knife - they know how to rock - Japanese punk pop at its best.\"\n\nAdvance tickets available from WeGotTickets Gigantic Tickets SEE Tickets and TicketWeb UK fro \u00a312.50 or \u00a315 on the door\n\nLinks\nShonen Knife Home site: http://www.shonenknife.net/\nShonen Knife Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ShonenKnifeOfficial\nShonen Knife Twitter: https://twitter.com/ShonenKnife\nDamnably: http://www.damnably.com@",

We'll shoot some scenes for the film at the pillow fight - you could be in the movie!. Spread the word about us and in return we'll keep bringing you madness like this. \n\n----\nPHOTOS AND VIDEOS:\n\nPost your photos and videos to our facebook page and we will share them all to everyone who attended. \n\nTweets: Use the #soundasleeppillowfight hastag and we'll add your videos to our official youtube playlist, and retweet your photos.\n\nPlaylist: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2wLjH33TVf3CrVJLDkq4uhNJpnnh8kIP\n\n----\nPILLOW FIGHT RULES\n\n\nWAIT FOR THE SIGNAL  -  BARKING BATTERIA SAMBA BAND and SOUND ASLEEP will count the event in. Wait till you hear \"READY, TEDDY, GO!\" - Then the Band will go for it, and so should you!\n\n\n**PLEASE PLAY NICE! NO ONE WANTS TO GET HURT**\n\n1. Wear something that says bedtime: \nPYJAMAS, Dressing Gown, Onesie. And take your glasses off.\n\n2. Bring a pillow. \nAnd keep it HIDDEN till we start at 3pm. (LISTEN FOR THE SAMBA BAND)\n\nUsing foam pillows or pillow slips will help reduce mess.  \n\nNo cushions and don't over fill or harden your pillow. Soft and fluffy is just right. This is just for fun!\n\n3. Play nice - don't pick on anyone much smaller than you, don't hit anyone too hard.\n\n4. Only pillow fight with people holding pillows. If someone looks unhappy help them away from the action.\n\n5. If you have allergies to feathers make sure to take your anti-hystamines.\n\n6. Don't hit anyone holding a camera.\n\n7. Please bring a plastic or BIN BAG. If we each CLEAN UP THE MESS of one pillow, maybe they'll let us do it again next year. \n\n8. Updates on the day from Sound Asleep on facebook - \nwww.facebook.com/SoundAsleepFilm \nand on twitter: \nwww.twitter.com/SoundAsleepFilm - #soundasleeppillowfight \n\n9. Share your photos and videos on the sound asleep facebook page. We all want to see those amazing photos afterwards and we'll be running our photo competitions for photos shared at www.facebook.com/SoundAsleepFilm\n\n\nSound Asleep did not set this up, in fact we have no idea who did!   We just like to spread the word.\n\n-----\nUPDATE:\n\nTimeout are reporting that the Mayor's office have warned that there will be some maintenance on the square on the day. We cannot comment on the authenticity of the reports but suspect they are keen to reduce numbers. It's up to you if you attend. This is not Sound Asleep's event to cancel, it is yours. We will continue to spread the messages that we believe encourage this event to go off in a safe, responsible and light hearted way. \n\nPlease clean up after yourselves.\nPlease don't fight too hard and don't risk hurting anyone.",

He loved playing for us last time and couldn't wait to come back and when we got asked wether we would like to book him we couldn't  really say no to a DJ who starts his set with Wu Tang's \"36 Chambers\" and finishes off with some heavy techno.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/officialmosca\n\nSouth London Ordnance has been someone who we have kept a very keen eye on and with a run of releases on labels such as Hotflush, Aery Metals and Warp he has established himself as a massive force within the electronic music scene and 2014 is looking set to be his biggest year. With a huge release due to drop soon on  Scuba's mighty Hotflush we are very excited to be giving him his Sheffield debut!\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/southlondonordnance\n\n\nIn support of the above is Ohm Sweet Ohm resident Pedram who will hopefully be in a fit enough state to play having played at Global Gathering the night before with the likes of Dense & Pika, James Zabiela  and Cirez D. \nKeep an eye out for his next EP which shall be coming out on Born Electric in the coming months.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Pedram/199971046711899\n\n\nThis Ohm Sweet Ohm falls on the same weekend that  Tramlines is on, but you won't need a wristband or any special tickets to get in.

        "description": "With the album \u201dElectric\u201d Amund Maarud (30) is kind of back where he started deeply into the blues tradition. The album marks Amund\u00b4s 20 years as a blues musician with release as early as the age of 10! However for those who think this is a regular blues release, do think again. There are a variety of styles on this album, and people in guitar rock tradition will probably note this as a rock release.\n\nAmund Maarud first started in the band Maarudkara at the age of 6 with his brother Henrik on drums and his father on bass. They came second on the yearly talent competition on NRK in 1997 and released the first album \u201dFirst Blues\u201d the year after. Later he had his youth playing in the houseband at the Oslo\u00b4s legendary blues club Muddy Waters.\n\n\u201dSome choices you just make without considering options. When I was 10 I just decided to become a bluesguitarist fulltime. It didn\u00b4 seem any more strange to me than the wish to become a fireman\u201d says Amund Maarud\n\nIn the year 2000 he started Amund Maarud Band, still with his brother Henrik on drums and with straight blues on the repertoire. The band was nominated for a Norwegian Grammy at Spellemannprisen 2003 for the debut album \u201dRipped, Stripped & Southern Fried\u201d, and received good acclaim for the follow up album \u201dCommotion\u201d.\nThe band was one of the most sought after on the Norwegian live blues scene, but the \u201dyoung hope\u201d of blues wanted to experiment more with rock musicand in 2006 they started The Grand.\n\nThey started their own record company and released both an EP and album in 2007. They were nominated to the Alarm\u2010award for best live band the same year. \n\nThe Grand held a number of concerts both in Norway and abroad and was noted at festivals such as \u00d8ya festival, Roskilde, Eurosonic and even \u201dRockpalast\u201d on German TV.",

It's music from the sweaty hearts of husband and wife Tom and Dede and band mate Darren Bancroft.  \n\nWHB toured their previous releases intensely, but now it's about taking it back to the dance floor - the place that inspired them to make music together in the first place. \n\nThere was a simple rule when writing songs for this album: if they didn't make the band move at first conception, then they didn't make the cut.  The result is an A list of deadly, ruthless and energetic cuts - all refined, polished and turned to gold by the magical hands of Tim Goldsworthy. \n\nMOVEMENTS celebrates the sacred union of beat and lyric. When Darren sings on You Only \"Your movements stayed with me all day long, your mind was always on mine\u201d it is the Moog line working with the vocal melody that stays with you. Dede\u2019s assertion on Burning On My Lips that, \u201cStanding in the line, first to lose my mind, don\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s wrong, this is where I belong\u201d is delivered with a conviction that the kick drum stamps out with every pulse.  It's that repetitious, powerful mantra that makes MOVEMENTS a record impossible not to feel, impossible not to move to. The record that the band always set out to make.\n\nhttp://www.wehaveband.com/\n\nTickets: http://bit.ly/TcyTxd",

These experiences and their obsession with the music they were hearing from within and across the German border, encouraged them to make the step from DJ to producer.\n\nIn 1996 Tiefschwarz was created and they began working together with acclaimed producer Peter Hoff in Stuttgart. After a few remixes, their first single \"Music\" was released in 1998 on Benztown and \"Wave Music\" NY. The success of the single motivated Tiefschwarz to record their debut album \"Ral 9005\" which came out on Four Music in 2000. \"Ral 9005\" was then seized upon by Derrick Carter & Luke Solomon for their Classic Recordings label in the UK in 2002. The album and the subsequent 4 singles (Thru a Little Window, Hello Again, Never, Nix) were received enthusiastically by both the English and international press, not to mention a growing fan base of music aficionados.\n\nIn 2002 Classic also released Ali & Basti's mix album \"A Little Help For Your Friends\" and their DJing career reached new heights with tours in Australia, the USA as well as gigs as far afield as Brazil and Russia\n\n2003 saw the brothers up sticks and move to the creative capital of Berlin where they set up a new studio along with new producer & friend, Jochen Schmalbach. Continuing their burgeoning career as remixers (with previous greats such as their reworks of Masters at Work, Ultra Nat\u00e9, Boogie Solitaire, Freaks, Isolee, Groove Armada) Ali and Basti went on to remix the likes of The Rapture, Cassius, Spektrum, Micatone, Lost & Alive, Lopazz, Osunlade, Minimal Compact, Tr\u00fcby Trio, DJ Hell, Kelis, and Missy Elliott.\n\nTheir last single on Classic; \"Nix\" was the grand finale to a very special relationship and from there they joined and helped create 'Fine Records' in London (a division of Four Music, their former label in Germany). The first single was 'Ghost Track' accompanied by a Black Strobe remix followed by their fantastic 'Misch Masch' album which not only showcased their talent as DJs but also their remixing prowess on a double CD release.\n\nThe majority of 2004 and 2005 was spent juggling a high profile DJing career, whilst writing and producing their second and long awaited album 'Eat Books'. The first single from the album 'Isst was released in 2005 and was voted one of the best singles of the year by Trax and DJ magazine. After that came 'Wait and See' with vocals by Chikinki, Morning Siren' with vocals by Matt B.Safer from the Rapture followed by 'Fly' with a Steve Bug remix and then 'Damage' with Tracey Thorn and accompanied by a brilliant Mandy remix.\n\n2006 was a big year for remixes, amongst other things. Three high profile mixes of Depeche Mode 'John The Revelator', Madonna's 'Get Together', Roxy Music's 'Rain Rain Rain' and Booka Shade's 'Darko'. Additionally, they released 2 mix albums - one for the outstanding Fabric series and the other in conjunction with the Time Warp festival in Germany.\n\n2006 was also the year that Tiefschwarz began their own label - SOUVENIR. The project that Ali & Basti had excitedly planned for years with old friend Arthur Velasquez, finally came to fruition. The first release of course was a Tiefschwarz track called 'Hey', under a different moniker of 'Ichundu' which prompted fellow DJs and the press to conclude that Tiefschwarz were once again at the top of their league. The label has also carved itself a definitive position in the dance record industry of today by offering a continuous release of stand out tracks from artists such as Phonique, Riton, Tom Mangan, Ziggy Kinder, Ruede Hagelstein and The Psychonauts. \n\n2007 2008 2009\nbesides traveling the world as djs again tiefschwarz moved the studio and took philipp maier aka sante\u00b4on board as their new studio and label partner.. \nso the story continues ;-)",

        "description": "Family Fodder was originally formed in 1979 by Alig Pearce - with a cast of thousands over three decades. They emerged from the melting-pot of 70s/80s London alongside This Heat, The Flying Lizards, The Pop Group, Slits and many others. The original formula consisted of psychedelic and new wave influences, incisive song-writing, improvisation, experiment and far-out dub mixing. They always managed to evade major exposure, but influenced generations of bands on five continents. Family Fodder was often more at home in the studio than on-stage, but completed several European tours as well as cherished performances in their native London.\n\nThe group released a series of compelling, now collectable singles and albums between 1979 and 1983. Described as \"entertaining idiosyncratic experimentalism with pop sensibilities\", they were best known for indie-chart hits such as \"Debbie Harry\", \"Playing Golf (With My Flesh Crawling)\" and \"Savoir Faire\". More recently, Family Fodder songs have been covered by Zion Train and Unrest, and they've been hailed as \"unsung heroes\" in The Wire.\n\nFamily Fodder also appear on the infamous Nurse With Wound list. \"Their music was generally playful, a hint of dub and reggae mixed with absurd, blissful pop, with synthpunk and sometimes experimental instrumentation. Most of the lyrics were also sung in French, courtesy of original vocalist Dominique Levillain, a combination rumored to be of some significant influence over Stereolab.\" (Systems of Romance)",

Auf ihren ersten vier Alben warf die 1978 gegr\u00fcndete Band The Monochrome Set auf beispiellose Art Dandyismus, Psychedelia, Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll, Kunststudentenunfug, Surf und britische Exzentrik zusammen \u2013 und erfand so ganz nebenbei den Indie-Pop. The Monochrome Set waren mithin mindestens so wichtig wie ihre Kollegen von Orange Juice. Allerdings wei\u00df das kaum jemand. Kaum jemand au\u00dfer dem S\u00e4nger Morrissey und dem Gitarrist Johnny Marr, die sich Ger\u00fcchten zufolge zum Zeitpunkt der Gr\u00fcndung ihrer Band The Smiths gerade \u00fcber eine Monochrome-Set-Platte beugten. Oder John Peel, der die Band verehrte. Oder Vampire Weekend. Oder Django Django. Oder Belle & Sebastian. Oder Franz Ferdinand, die gleich weite Teile der Klang\u00e4sthetik ihrer Helden \u00fcbernahmen. The Monochrome Set sind insofern so etwas wie der Prototyp einer stilpr\u00e4genden Band, der in ihrer Glanzphase \u2013 hier: der Post-Punk-\u00c4ra \u2013 wenig Erfolg beschieden war, aber zahllose Bandgr\u00fcndungen zu verantworten hat.\nSeit ihrer Wiedervereinigung ver\u00f6ffentlichte die Band um S\u00e4nger Bid und Gitarrist Lester Square, der hauptberuflich als Kunstlehrer an einer Londoner M\u00e4dchenschule wirkt, zwei neue Alben, die nahtlos an die distinguierten und bisweilen bizarren Schrammel-Werke ihrer Fr\u00fchphase ankn\u00fcpfen. Im King Georg ist die legend\u00e4re Band bereits zum dritten Mal zu bewundern.\n\nDatum: MI. 19.03.2014\nEinlass: 20.00 Uhr\nBeginn: 21.00\nAbendkasse: 13 EUR\n\nVVK unter:\nhttps://www.tixforgigs.com/site/Pages/Shop/ShowEvent.aspx?ID=8774",

Riding high off the label\u2019s success in 2013, and picking up speed for the monumental 10 years of Shogun festivities, the night will flaunt an extensive range of talent the label has harnessed.\n\nFor the next Shogun London, Friction & Co. have called on an elite group of artists that are at the forefront of the UK bass music movement. Drawing on Calyx & Teebee\u2019s no-nonsense approach to filling dancefloors, and Radio 1 resident Rockwell\u2019s outside of the box track selection to get things started. Adding to that Rinse FM\u2019s bass music tastemaker Icicle, plus two of drum n bass\u2019s favourite duos in the form of Spectrasoul and Technimatic to get those tickets flying out the door. Also stepping up will be leaders of the new school Stray and Sam Binga. \n\nNew Shogun recruit Joe Ford has been soaring through the ranks with his blend of the heavy and melodic, he\u2019ll be playing b2b with Fourward. Not forgetting the debut performance from Neuropol, who\u2019s EP for the label will be revealed soon. Bringing some of that vintage appeal will be Randall with one of his legendary jungle sets, that\u2019ll leave you reminiscing of back in the day.\n\nOf course no Shogun night would be complete without the legendary 2 hour throwdowns from label boss Friction guaranteed to destroy the dance and take no prisoners on the way. With all the usual suspects on the mic, you can guarantee SP:MC, AD, Mantmast and Linguistics will get you hyped up in typical Shogun style. \n\n*\n\"Regrettably and due to circumstances out of both Shogun Audio and LWE's control, we have been forced to change the venue of our next London show in April to Fire. No stranger to hosting some of the best underground events in the city, Fire will make the perfect host for a night that will showcase the best in bass music. Nothing else has changed - expect cutting edge drum n bass from Shogun artists and special guests, plus LWE will be working their magic on the venue and beefing up the Funktion 1 sound system to give it that extra punch. Tickets already purchased for the event at Pulse will still be valid at Fire.\u201d\n\n\nAdvanced Tickets: \u00a310 - \u00a325 + bf\nEarly Birds SOLD OUT!\nwww.londonwarehouseevents.co.uk\n\nIn association with Mixcloud // \nwww.mixcloud.com/lwe \n\nT&Cs \nhttp://londonwarehouseevents.co.uk/terms-conditions/ \n\nwww.londonwarehouseevents.co.uk \nwww.shogunaudio.co.uk",

Standard tickets are available here - http://bit.ly/1e3BCr4\nor you can buy from the Jazz Cafe direct - http://bit.ly/LS9rOP\n\nIn 2004 Matt Sellors (lead singer) started a 3-piece blues outfit named Sellors and the Scientists. All students of Dartington College of Arts they gained notoriety as an original and exciting new live act. Members came and went but the core stayed the same and after graduating the band moved to Bristol. It was only then that Yes Sir Boss was really born. YSB soon began to make its mark as one of Bristol's best live bands and signed to Joss Stones' label Stone'd Records in 2010. Armed with their d\u00e9but album Desperation State they sailed onto the festival circuit and began what was to become a long and wonderful journey into the fields and clubs of the UK and beyond.\n\nOver 300 gigs later, Yes Sir Boss continues to cultivate truly original and inspiring music, captivating audiences with their energy at many of the UK and Europe's best festivals. Summer 2013 saw the departure of long standing guitarist Luke Potter and a period of transition as the band evolved their sound and worked on new material. Now reformed and revitalised as a 5 piece, Yes Sir Boss have a 2nd album ready to record that moves away from their Ska infused past and explores the more blues/rock element of their sound.\n\nWith one album out (Desperation State, 2012) Yes Sir Boss aim to impress their fans for a second time with their new album due for release Spring / Summer 2014. Further touring is planned for Germany, The Netherlands, France, Austria and Switzerland and Scandinavia. Their ambition grows daily and they remain one of the UK's most exciting new bands. They are a must see for anyone with a love of music and an appreciation for what it is to be a band.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/yessirboss\nhttp://www.yessirboss.com/\n\n\nSupport from Solko\nSolko are a 7 piece band with brass, bass, guitars, percussion blending an eclectic mix of reggae/dub rhythms with soulful vocals and melodic jazz horns.\n\n2013 saw the band appear at festivals such as Secret Garden Party, Kendal Calling, Beat Herder and were deemed one of the 'Hidden Gems'\nof the Soundwave festival in Croatia. Solko went on to completely sell out prestigious venue Norwich Arts Centre to top off a big summer. The band are currently recording a new record which is due for release in April/May 2014 with an accompanied UK tour.\n\n\"Bringing the values of classic dub production into a rockier frame of mind, this brass-bedecked 7-piece from Suffolk pack a mighty dance floor punch by way of crafty arrangements and show-off guitar.\"\n\nwww.soundcloud.com/solkomusic\nwww.facebook.com/solkomusic\nwww.solko.co.uk\n\nDoors 7pm - 11pm\nTickets are \u00a38 early bird\n\u00a310 standard\n\nYou can buy them online at\nwww.gigantic.com - http://bit.ly/1bJ18Mf\nwww.seetickets.com - http://bit.ly/1g2YIfO\nor from us direct at\nwww.intergalactic-music.co.uk - http://bit.ly/1e3BCr4\nor from the Jazz Cafe   -   http://bit.ly/LS9rOP",

The Toronto trio came together in 2008 with the desire to bring their blend of live electronic instrumentation to the stage.\n\nThey've often been referred to as the worlds only \"trap band,\" a title they reluctantly accept. Tune says it best: \"At the end of the day, people are going to call us whatever they want. We are referencing everything from classic house music to Timbaland in our beats, but I think the trap references tap into what the current sound is, and we are okay with that.\"\n\nHaving toured their unique blend of hip hop and bass music extensively across North America, Keys N Krates put out a slew of original music in 2013. Their most recent body of work, titled SOLOW EP, was released via Steve Aoki's Dim Mak Records in September 2013.\n\nThe EP features KNK's banger \"Treat Me Right,\" which launched with the support of figureheads like Diplo, Major Lazer, Flosstradamus, and TNGHT. It went to number one on Hype Machine, continues to chart on the Beatport Hip Hop Chart, and remains a fixture in DJ sets and car stereos across the globe.\n\nPremiered by Annie Mac on BBC Radio1, their second single off SOLOW EP, \"Dum Dee Dum,\" experienced a similar kind of success on the charts and has solidified the trio as creators of anthemic party music with a quickly growing fan base.\n\nKNK has since explored their love for rap music by creating a remix of \"Dum Dee Dum.\" Featuring G.O.O.D. Music's Cyhi The Prynce, King Louie, and Tree, the track has received glowing reviews from the likes of Fader Magazine, Vice Mag, and NahRight. \"We had so much fun doing that rap remix,\" says Flo. \"We can't wait to work with more rappers and vocalists in general.\"\n\nPerhaps what truly separates Keys N Krates from the mass of Electronic and Hip Hop producers out there is the unique show they create by performing their bassy beats as a band, completely live. When you go to a KNK show, you will see their music and the music of others morphed and turned on it's head using only drums, keys, turntables and live sampling. This unique style creates not only a crazy dance party, but an experience and vibe like no other.\n\nAs a result, KNK have found themselves playing some of the world's largest Festivals, including Lollapalooza, Electric Zoo, Ultra Music Festival, Osheaga, and Sonar Festival (to name a few.) As Matisse says, \"Our favourite thing is playing live and bringing people into our world.\"\n\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac \n\nWin a bunch of prizes just for coming out!\n\nBuztour is giving away 2 free tickets to catch the Raptors play the Pistons in Detroit with an on court experience after the game.\n\nTrack Avenue and Prevail Music will be giving away some free music and merchandise.\n\nAs well, our great friends from TEAMLTD will be giving you the chance at scoring some of their awesome gear.\n\nAnd of course, there will be some awesome drink specials throughout the night!\n\n\nFor hard tickets call or text 519 859 9417",

Lakuti stieg aus den Ruinen der Post-Apartheid in S\u00fcdafrika auf. Sie wuchs in dem verarmten Soweto in Johannesburg auf und interessierte sich schon in jungen Jahren f\u00fcr Musik, die Soul und Funk Platten ihrer Mutter oder die Jazz-Platten ihres Gro\u00dfvaters. Am meisten wurde sie jedoch von den Chicago-House Vinyls beeinflusst, die irgendwie ihren Weg in die Townships fanden. \nAnfang der 90iger stampfte sie ihren ersten, kleinen Club namens Panet Hendon aus dem Boden und brachte internationale DJs nach Johannesburg, erste Ver\u00f6ffentlichungen auf dem s\u00fcdafrikanischen Deep House Label Syndicate folgten. \nAllm\u00e4hlich war Lakuti mit der geographischen Isolation unzufrieden und zog erst drei Jahre nach Toronto und schlie\u00dflich nach London.  Dort promotete sie gemeinsam mit Earl Gateshead ihre Party im Club Plastic People. Lakutis Partyreihe hatte schon G\u00e4ste wie Juan Atkins, Move D, Rick Wade, Pantha Du Prince, Shed  oder Tama Sumo. Mit letzterer spielt sie \u00fcbrigens im Februar 2014 in der Panorama Bar.\n2007 gr\u00fcndete Lakuti die Agentur The Uzuri Artist Bookings & Management Agency und repr\u00e4sentiert K\u00fcnstler wie Levon Vincent, Fred P, Big Strick, Portable/Bodycode oder Chicago Skyway. Sie spielte bereits in Clubs wie Fabric (London), Panorama Bar (Berlin) und Rex Club (Paris). Gemeinsam mit Portable und Tama Sumo hat sie j\u00fcngst das S\u00fcd Electronic Imprint wieder aufleben lassen. \n\n+ Special Guest:\nF\u00fcr den Support haben wir noch einen Freund der Familie und Saufkumpane am Start. Christan Nikolaus, 23 Jahre alt, 6. Semester Kommunikationsdesign an der Akademie der bildenden K\u00fcnste Stuttgart, in der Fachklasse Corperate Design. Er legt nebenher regelm\u00e4\u00dfig auf Aka Partys auf, hin und wieder in den Waggons und kleineren privaten Veranstaltungen. In jungen Jahren spielte er ausschlie\u00dflich Hip Hop und zum House kam er durch alte Funk und Disco platten seines Onkels.\n\nwww.residentadvisor.net/dj/lakuti\nwww.lloveit.com\n\nVor Mitternacht 6\u20ac, danach 8\u20ac",

Dunque si offre pure ai cittadini una spettacolarit\u00e0 inconsueta, quella fatta da persone che accettano il rischio di fallire creando pubblicamente.\n\nDalla scheda di \u201cVerranno giorni che non baster\u00e0 guardare\u201d (http://goo.gl/tjAJli):\n\nLe basi\n\nSono convinto che contino le azioni. E che solo se un'azione nasce da un'urgenza pu\u00f2 sortire un effetto. Che preparare un'azione non significa prevedere ci\u00f2 che faremo, bens\u00ec abbandonarsi a ci\u00f2 che ci accadr\u00e0, per tentare di fare accadere qualcosa. Che ci si pu\u00f2 allenare all'abbandono. Che occorre avere il coraggio di confondersi, di sperimentare avventura. Che un teatro possibile \u00e8 quello di cittadini fra cittadini. Che proprio la creazione deve nutrirsi di provvisoriet\u00e0. Che scegliendo con sana incoscienza spazi, modi e tempi apparentemente inopportuni, gli artisti si affrancano da quello status civitatis che li fa cittadini maldestri fra un pubblico di uomini declassati e votati al silenzio: gli artisti si possono fare artigiani di incontri. L'incontro \u00e8 tanto pi\u00f9 vero quanto pi\u00f9 la sua provvisoriet\u00e0 \u00e8 condivisa con il pubblico: si pu\u00f2 provare a fare un teatro che nasca proprio dagli incontri, anzich\u00e9 pretendersi compiuto per affrontare incontri. Si pu\u00f2 sperimentare un teatro che abbia il coraggio di mostrarsi \"brutto\", perch\u00e9 sta tentando di avvenire. Si pu\u00f2, non \"si deve\". La certezza di essere nel giusto \u00e8 la nemica peggiore dell'avventura. \n\nUn teatro fatto con i gesti e con le parole incerte di chi abita uno spazio a lui nuovo, ma non essendo da solo ha bisogno di cercare mezzi utili a comunicare. \n\nUn teatro che ha come primo scopo quello di cercare un pubblico per tentare di accadere, divenendo.\n\nLo stage\n\nPropongo un lavoro pubblico con un gruppo di attori, che siano disposti ad assumersi il rischio pi\u00f9 alto, quello di fallire creando pubblicamente: che accettino di operare in condizioni di paura e di difficolt\u00e0. Davanti a testimoni sempre nuovi, ad un pubblico cercato e trovato che, oltre che raggiungere gli attori, sia raggiunto dagli attori. \n\nIl lavoro si svolge per met\u00e0 in un teatro o sala e per met\u00e0 fuori, con incursioni in diversi luoghi della citt\u00e0 (su strada e non solo).\nAgli spettatori cos\u00ec incontrati, non vengono proposti spettacoli pronti: con il pubblico si scende a patti, si chiede attenzione, si racconta e si mostra quello che sta avvenendo, con la coscienza che da una curiosit\u00e0 reciproca pu\u00f2 nascere lo stupore.\n\nSi sperimenta un teatro che non ha fretta di trovare armonie, che rifugge i virtuosismi e la forma fine a se stessa. Un teatro che inizia inchiodando il corpo dell'attore alla gestualit\u00e0 deviata di chi ha semplicemente dei fogli in mano e deve guardarli senza dimenticare che pi\u00f9 avanti, oltre a quei fogli, ci sono altri corpi e altri occhi. Un teatro di chi con quei fogli in mano non si limita a leggere, ma vive dialogando, raccontando e agendo in uno spazio condiviso con un pubblico.\n\nBase degli attori \u00e8 quindi il teatro (o sala), dove affinano la drammaturgia, ri-scrivono e interpretano il copione, sperimentano il racconto a soggetto per sintesi e ritorno, organizzano le spedizioni, riprovano a recitare quanto gi\u00e0 sperimentato all\u2019esterno e accolgono chi entra: il teatro \u00e8 sempre aperto al pubblico.\n\nQuale conclusione, sperimentazione e concretizzazione del metodo acquisito, alla sera dell\u2019ultimo giorno i partecipanti restituiscono pubblicamente il risultato del lavoro svolto.\n\n\nSuggestioni per i partecipanti\n\nAlcuni pensieri di Gian Renzo Morteo:\n\n\"\u2026Il sociale \u00e8 il rapporto vivo, bidirezionale scena-platea e viceversa.\nQuindi: avvenimento, imprevisto, improvvisazione, continua evoluzione dello spettacolo.\nNon soltanto rappresentazione: favola, modo di essere\u2026\" \n\n\"Essere ascoltati: una conquista, non un presupposto, tanto meno un diritto\"\n\n\u201dL\u2019imitazione, la vera imitazione, non \u00e8 copia, \u00e8 trasformazione, trasfigurazione, rielaborazione fantastica\u201d.\n        \n\u201dSe togliamo tutto ci\u00f2 che si pu\u00f2 togliere a uno spettacolo teatrale, constatiamo che due sono gli elementi indispensabili affinch\u00e9 il teatro resti teatro: l\u2019attore e il pubblico\u201d \n\n\nFonti per la drammaturgia\n\nOltre all'indispensabile lettura del romanzo, utile per i partecipanti la pagina dedicata a Martin Eden su wikipedia.org: http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Eden\n\n\n_________________\n\n\nMarco Gobetti  - Attore, regista e drammaturgo attivo dagli anni \u201890, coniuga da sempre l'attivit\u00e0 di prosa su strada a quella nei teatri.

All'atto della fondazione, la Compagnia Marco Gobetti assume il repertorio degli spettacoli gi\u00e0 scritti e realizzati da Marco Gobetti con la compagnia Il Barrito degli Angeli.\nLa Compagnia si caratterizza come luogo di scambio ed incontro fra artisti diversi per percorsi ed esperienze: un gruppo eterogeneo, variabile e modulabile a seconda dei progetti intrapresi.  \n\nSpettacoli\n\nVoglio un pappagallo \u2013 Matthew Smith: il p(r)ezzo della vita di un uomo (2006)\nUna rocambolesca corsa fra tinte gialle rosa e noir, una tragicomica lotta contro ogni tempo e ogni spazio: Matthew Smith conoscer\u00e0 se stesso solo alla fine, quando diventer\u00e0 emblema e rivelazione di un esecrabile anonimato del dolore. \nIN-EC-ESSO \u2013 Una bomba per cintura (2007)\nUn operaio il pomeriggio di un venerd\u00ec d\u2019estate non usc\u00ec dalla fabbrica e si rintan\u00f2 nel cesso. L\u00ec trascorse il fine settimana, scrivendo per due giorni e tre notti su un computer palmare e facendo precise richieste: se queste non fossero state accettate entro le ore 6 del luned\u00ec successivo, l'operaio si sarebbe fatto esplodere con il cesso, i muri e le macchine della fabbrica.\nQuesto \u00e8 un fatto realmente accaduto, ma nessuno lo sa e nessuno lo sapr\u00e0 mai. Perch\u00e9 nessuno \u00e8 autorizzato a crederci.\n\nLo stagno (2008 \u2013 riallestimento \u2013 Patrocinio della Citt\u00e0 di Torino)\nUn uomo e una donna.\nLui veste una divisa militare e ha un paio di scarponi ai piedi, lei ha i piedi scalzi e indossa un vestito a fiori.\nLui \u00e8 tornato da una guerra. Lei no.\nLei vuole festeggiare il suo ritorno. Lui non vuole.\nLei vuole che lui ricordi di quando si volevano bene e di suo nonno e delle storie che raccontava e di tante altre cose, ma lui non vorrebbe: forse ricorder\u00e0. Lui tiene tanto ai suoi scarponi.\nLei vuole che lui riveda i propri genitori, lui non vorrebbe: forse li rivedr\u00e0. Lui tiene tanto ai suoi scarponi.\nLei canta e vuole che lui canti, lui non vorrebbe: forse canter\u00e0. Lui tiene tanto ai suoi scarponi.\nLei vuole che lui si tolga la divisa, lui non vorrebbe: forse la toglier\u00e0. Lui tiene tanto ai suoi scarponi.\nLei vuole che lui si tolga gli scarponi.\nE glielo chiede tante volte.\nLui non vuole. E nega tante volte.\nLei insiste tante volte. Lui le chiede un bacio in cambio, tante volte.\nE lei glielo nega, tante volte.\nMa che cosa c'\u00e8 negli scarponi?\n\nLa memoria non \u00e8 mai cimitero \u2013 I meccanismi della Shoah nella storia dell\u2019uomo (2008)\nUn attore e un musicista impegnati nell\u2019analisi della Shoah del secolo scorso e delle shoah in atto o incombenti ai giorni nostri, alla luce delle infinite violenze mortali (di massa e non solo) che si sono ripetute nel corso della Storia.\nUna sorta di spettacolo-concerto, volto a suscitare un interesse partecipe e stupito. Dalla fiaba occidentale pi\u00f9 antica, alla strage dei Melii da parte degli Ateniesi, agli eccidi degli Indios testimoniati da Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas, ai pensieri scritti da Hitler e spaventosamente analoghi a tanta comunicazione contemporanea; oltre che alle azioni compiute da Hitler e tremendamente simili a tante vicende contemporanee: ad unire il tutto una drammaturgia originale fatta di racconti, versi in libert\u00e0, musica, canto e di un\u2019urgenza \ncontinuamente altalenante fra comprensione e comunicazione.\n\nCristo muore in fabbrica: \u00e8 solo un altro incidente (2009 - con il sostegno del Sistema Teatro Torino e il Patrocinio della Citt\u00e0 di Torino e della CGIL)\nCristo si reincarna in un ladro che, tornando dal mare alla guida di un\u2019auto rubata, \u00e8 vittima di un incidente; soccorso, ruba un\u2019ambulanza e scappa. Vittima di un altro incidente - non riesce a centrare la porta di un casello -, viene estratto dal mezzo in fiamme. Stranamente il corpo non presenta ustioni, ma ha segni di frustate e una ferita nel costato. L\u2019uomo chiede da bere e poi parla: \u201cAdesso che sono tornato, mi reincarner\u00f2 in molti altri\u201d. Detto questo, scompare. La notizia si diffonde e centinaia di persone si accalcano in caserme, ospedali e parrocchie, avanzando il sospetto di essere il Cristo. Il Vaticano prende cautamente posizione. La situazione precipita quando si scopre che il corpo di un operaio estratto da una fabbrica in fiamme, oltre che segni di frustate e una ferita nel costato, ha una corona di spine in testa... \n\nL\u2019ANCIOV\u00c9 SOTA SAL (2011 - prodotto con il sostegno di Regione Piemonte, Assessorato alla Cultura, Fondazione Teatro Ragazzi e Giovani Onlus e Istituto per i Beni Marionettistici e il Teatro Popolare)\nUn uomo sogna una notte di essere un venditore di acciughe che finisce sotto sale fra le sue stesse acciughe, dentro al barile che le contiene. Questo \u00e8 un sogno che lascer\u00e0 il suo segno nella vita dell'uomo e in quella delle persone che incontrer\u00e0:\n\u201cA val nen tant \u00ebl seugn: / col seugn a l'\u00e9 la spluva ch'a 'nvisca 'l feau. / A val c\u00f2sa ch'a l'\u00e9 capit\u00e0ie d\u00f2p\u201d\n(Non vale tanto il sogno: / quel sogno \u00e8 la scintilla che accende il fuoco. / Vale ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 capitato dopo)\nNell\u2019\"Anciov\u00e9 sota sal\" si sperimenta un uso poetico e contemporaneo del dialetto piemontese, in un allestimento fondato sulla coesione fra componente attoriale, visiva e musicale. Lo spettacolo ha tre brevi intermezzi in italiano: una sorta di prologo in itinere che ogni volta riassume ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 avvenuto e anticipa ci\u00f2 che avverr\u00e0, pure per facilitare la comprensione a chi non conoscesse il dialetto. \n\nLA METAMORFOSI DI KAFKA \u2013 Lettura integrale in concerto (2011 \u2013 in collaborazione con Realt\u00e0 Debora Mancini) \nLa paradossale e pure incredibilmente verosimile vicenda di Gregor Samsa, viene divisa in quattro parti: due attori e due attrici si avvicendano per leggere in quattro tempi \u201cLa metamorfosi\u201d di Franz Kafka. Ogni parte del racconto vive di uno stile e di una lettura interpretativa differente, in quanto affidata ad artisti fra loro eterogenei per esperienza e formazione; l\u2019esecuzione dal vivo di un musicista polistrumentista si interseca, al terna ed accompagna. Una girandola di sensibilit\u00e0 alla prova per sublimare in azione drammatica la commovente tragedia di un protagonista indimenticabile, che \u00e8 fra le pi\u00f9 alte incarnazioni della sensibilit\u00e0 moderna e contemporanea. \n\nBestiame etimologico (2012 - co-produzione con l'Istituto per i Beni Marionettistici e il Teatro Popolare)\nBestiame etimologico si pone nella prospettiva di proiettarsi a ritroso nel tempo, per rintracciare il valore della parola quale atto di creazione.\nA prendere corpo \u00e8 una cosmogonia che nasce dalle parole, appunto, che si inanellano in forma di favola, segnando il destino dell'umanit\u00e0. Una cosmogonia visionaria e imprevedibile, di disarmante semplicit\u00e0 quanto stupefacente. \n\n1863-1992 | DI GIOVANNI IN OLTRE \u2013 Storia d'Italia e di persone da Giovanni Corrao a Giovanni Falcone (2012)\nL'incredibile storia di un uomo dell'Ottocento che si trasforma in un uccellino, per diventare un uomo del Novecento e oltre. \nLa violenza usata con disinvoltura dai poteri forti dello Stato - quegli stessi che dovrebbero essere garanti di giustizia - segna il processo che porta all\u2019unificazione formale dell\u2019Italia, dando luogo a una inquietante deriva verso un sistema viziato e pericoloso: un\u2019oligarchia che, sotto la maschera di un'apparente legalit\u00e0, infetta tuttora i poteri dello Stato e agisce manipolando il diritto, per perseguire interessi di parte e per ridurre intere masse di cittadini all'ignavia culturale e politica.\n\nProgetti\n\nDOVE SONO NATO NON LO SO \u2013 Una settimana di lettura accampata tra i filari in occasione del centesimo anniversario della nascita di Cesare Pavese (2008, in collaborazione con la Fondazione Circuito Teatrale del Piemonte e il Patrocinio della casa editrice Einaudi). \nTre attori si alternano alla lettura consecutiva dell\u2019intera opera di Cesare Pavese, accampati in tenda per \nuna settimana (9-16 settembre 2008) in cima a una collina del Roero, con le Langhe all\u2019orizzonte. La loro voce, per quattordici ore al giorno (dalle ore 10 alle 24), complice una potentissima amplificazione innestata sui pali dei filari, risuona sin gi\u00f9 a valle e accoglie gli spettatori in arrivo: le parole di Cesare Pavese, parendo divenire emanazione delle vigne stesse, accompagnano il pubblico mentre sosta, mangia gi\u00f9 a valle, parte alla volta del bricco e sale arrancando sulla capezzagna fra le vigne, per raggiungere la fonte della spettacolarit\u00e0. \n \nI Santi sulla strada (dicembre 2009) \nEvento itinerante in otto Comuni ad alta marginalit\u00e0 del Piemonte. Un attore percorre in macchina 1015 chilometri in tre giorni, fermandosi in undici Comuni del Piemonte. Davanti al Municipio di ogni Comune sosta per un'ora, leggendo in lingua originale brani dalla Legenda Aurea di Jacopo da Varagine (1228-1298) riguardanti la vita o la vicenda del Santo Patrono del luogo; immediatamente dopo la lettura racconta a soggetto in italiano quanto appena letto in latino. \n\nLa vera storia di Hilario Halubras (2010) \nProgetto di produzione culturale che utilizza la drammaturgia e la recitazione su strada per arricchire l'immaginario collettivo con una figura viva, una maschera contemporanea (Hilario Halubras).

Costante dell\u2019evento \u00e8 la diffusione nell\u2019aria delle parole dello scrittore, secondo una ciclicit\u00e0 predefinita che alterna artisti e avvicenda nuclei artistici in luoghi diversi della citt\u00e0.\nQuattro attori, accompagnati da due musicisti interpretano consecutivamente le opere di Franz Kafka: gli artisti si alternano dal primo pomeriggio a sera fra Riva Caccia, fronte LAC (presso la stele in porfido) e piazza Cioccaro per leggere i romanzi \"Il processo\" e \"Il Castello\", il racconto \"La metamorfosi\" e un\u2019antologia delle altre opere dello scrittore.\nUn tempo, uno spazio e un\u2019azione liberamente condivisibili per sublimare nella ricerca di incontro ed empatia fra artisti e cittadini, l\u2019assurdit\u00e0 sapiente, la speranza disarmante e la profonda umanit\u00e0 dell\u2019universo kafkiano.\n\nLezioni recitate (2011-2013, in collaborazione con il Centro studi Piero Gobetti e con il sostegno del Comitato Resistenza e Costituzione del Consiglio Regionale del Piemonte)\nUn attore recita nelle scuole \u2013 e anche in circoli, biblioteche, librerie, centri di studio e di incontro \u2013 lezioni scritte dallo storico Leonardo Casalino (Universit\u00e8 Stendhal Grenoble 3), alle quali d\u00e0 corpo, voce e interpretazione:\n- Vittorio Foa - Pensare il mondo con curiosit\u00e0\n- Leone Ginzburg - Costruire il futuro nel presente\n- Emilio Lussu - Il romanzo inevitabile dell\u2019antifascismo italiano\n- Giaime e Luigi Pintor - Agire in modo utile\n- Camilla Ravera \u2013 Uniformare la vita a una convinzione\n- Umberto Terracini - La politica come partecipazione collettiva e difesa dell\u2019autonomia individuale \n\nIL COMICO E LA VITA - Da un saggio del filosofo Carlo Sini nasce una creazione pubblica (2012 - co-produzione con Realt\u00e0 Debora Mancini, in collaborazione con Comune di Cinisello Balsamo, con il sostegno di Fondazione Comunitaria NORD MILANO, CAF ACLI, Coop UniAbita, partner di progetto Comune di Solaro, Cinis Aeli Club)\n\nIL PENSIERO POLITICO: LETTURE INTEGRALI IN VETRINA \u2013 Prima e seconda puntata: \u201cLA CONQUISTA DEL PANE di P\u00ebtr Alekseevic Kropotkin\u201d e \u201cCOMPENDIO DEL CAPITALE di Carlo Cafiero\u201d (2012, in collaborazione con Lunetta11)\n\nVerranno giorni che non baster\u00e0 guardare \u2013 stage per attori di creazione pubblica (2012) \nUn lavoro pubblico con un gruppo di attori, che siano disposti ad assumersi il rischio pi\u00f9 alto, quello di fallire creando pubblicamente: che accettino di operare in condizioni di paura e di difficolt\u00e0. Davanti a \ntestimoni sempre nuovi, ad un pubblico cercato e trovato che, oltre che raggiungere gli attori, sia raggiunto dagli attori.  \n\nLA TRAGEDIA DELLA LIBERTA' tramite AZIONATE EMPATIE URBANE\u00ae (2013 \u2013 in collaborazione con Lunetta11) \nDi come lo Stato impose la chiusura delle scuole; e, per fare eseguire l\u2019ordinanza, ufficiali dell\u2019esercito furono nominati presidi; e in una scuola, nel giorno del commiato, accadde un imprevisto: di come, quando e perch\u00e9 quattro studenti, avendo sbranato un preside, cambiarono vita e nome. Ovvero: per la creazione di un nuovo mito. \nAzione pubblica che prepara la realizzazione dello spettacolo \u201cLa tragedia della libert\u00e0\u201d\n\nPoetica\n \nOccorre generare miti immaginifici. Gettare semi di rivolte possibili. \nIl teatro non pu\u00f2 limitarsi a relazionare, a documentare il reale, a dare informazioni utili o a tutelare memorie.\nIl teatro \u00e8 civile quando, astraendo dalla realt\u00e0 senza prescinderne, tenta di costruire civilt\u00e0, quando bada ai cives, offrendo loro possibilit\u00e0 molteplici di sogni, pensieri e azioni: quando \u00e8 energia che incontra energie, relazione che innesca relazioni. \nIl teatro pu\u00f2 essere civile dunque per l\u2019azione che lo muove (gli attori cittadini fra i cittadini, alla ricerca dei cittadini, i cives), ancora prima che per le tematiche che affronta: un pubblico da cercare, da raggiungere e da conquistare, non solo da aspettare. Per dirla con le parole di uno storico e teorico del teatro come Gian Renzo Morteo: \u201cEssere ascoltati: una conquista, non un presupposto, tanto meno un diritto\u201d. \n \nDettagli di poetica, attivit\u00e0 e percorsi:\n \nwww.compagniamarcogobetti.com\nwww.seunapecorabrucailsole.wordpress.com",

With over 100,000 units sold of his work, Asad\u2019s sprawling discography covers a multitude of dance music's most illustrious labels including Om, Global Underground, King Street, The End, Wall of Sound, Loveslap!, Tango, Urbantorque, Loaded, Visitor, as well as his own imprints Wrong and Reverberations. Having been dubbed a \u201cnew school hero\u201d by Muzik magazine, \u201cProducer for 2000\u201d by Mixmag, and a \u201cDJ for 2000\u201d in The Face, \u201cBest Compilation of 2003\u201d in M8, his distinctive sound has continually been winning appraisal from the industry\u2019s leading music publications and Dj\u2019s alike. Over the years his work has won the avid support of jocks as diverse as: Danny Tenaglia, Laurent Garnier, Mark Farina, Terry Francis, Mr. C, DJ Heather, Tom Middleton, Doc Martin, Adam Freeland, Gilles Peterson, Inland Knights, Fred Everything, Danny Howells, Desyn Massiello and seemingly countless others.\n\nAsad is not up there in the top 20 lists of the worlds' biggest DJs. He has nonetheless remained one of the busiest and most well-travelled London house jocks for many years. His infectious yet eclectic slant on House music has regularly proven to satisfy the most purist underground dance-floors to the most up-for-it big room crowds. Having graced the decks at hundreds of venues across five continents, he has made appearances at some of the world's most well respected venues including Fabric (London), Pacha (Buenos Aires), Stereo (Montreal), Folies Pigales (Paris), Roxy & Mecca (Prague), Crystal (Istanbul), The End (London), and playing to crowds of up to 20,000 people.\n\nHaving had an action-packed Summer touring far and wide from Mexico to Georgia with a string of sublime releases that have seen him moving back into more electronic house territories, Asad has been working overtime on new originals and remixes, a compilation, as well as travel plans to rock yet more dance-floors across the globe. An ever-ubiquitous presence in House music is here to stay and will indeed be a name you'll be hearing yet more of in 2011.\n\n\n7pm - Late // Over 18 // R.O.A.R // \u00a35 ADV // \u00a36 OTD",

Heads of Souvenir, their own label, the brothers have ensured the Tiefschwarz name is a byword for melody rich dance music.\n\nBelgian producer Locked Groove's dexterous mesh of life affirming U.S. House and the blackened Industrial Funk of European Techno makes him the quintessential modern day producer. Releases on Scuba's Hotflush and Red D's We Play House have cemented his status as a genuine crossover threat, with only the man himself knowing which direction his music will take next.\n\nA close associate of former X guests Clockwork, Italian producer Avatism has been turning heads around the world with his deep and mysterious musical creations. Bringing a bit of intrigue to the dancefloor he promises to play a captivating set when he turns out for us at Egg.",

        "description": "A night of hip hop, breakbeat, and dubstep....\n\nPETE CANNON & DR. SYNTAX\nJMAN\nSUPER SOUL SOLDIERS\nPWORD\nMAIR OF LONDON\nDISTURBANCE\nMR. BRISTOW\n\nPete Cannon  \n \n\"Boisterous Blackpudlian super-producer with hair so genius it's underappreciated in its own time.\u201d \nFor years \u2013 decades, even - hip hop music admirably trundled along, noticeably lacking a certain something.  \nNobody knew what that something was. All we knew was, it was something\u2026 Blackpool.  \nUntil the chance discovery of a battered old Moog synthesizer in a skip by a 12 year old Pete Cannon\u2019s father gave birth to a musical prodigy who has become one of the most prolific producers and hairstyles in the country. It\u2019s fair to say that if you have even a passing interest in UK hip hop music then there\u2019s a good chance you probably already like Pete Cannon.  \nProducer, DJ, Lad, Video Maker, Hair Mogul, Pete has amassed a list of production credits longer than some sort of massively long thing (like a huge snake or a tapeworm or something), with projects with the likes of Sway, Jam Baxter, Dirty Dike, Sonnyjim, Lunar C, Stig of the Dump, Million Dan and trans-Atlantic collaborations with Detroit legend Guilty Simpson, Action Bronson, Maffew Ragazino, with a cheeky play on US radio by DJ Premier thrown in for badman measure. Soz.  \nAlongside producing the hugely successful and adorably named Dirty Dike album \u2018Return of the Twat\u2019 (High Focus records), 2013 also saw Pete yield mainstream chart success by producing two tracks on Rizzle Kicks\u2019 album Roaring 20s - including the hit single Lost Generation.  \nOutside of hip hop production, Pete has been known to occasionally get on the mic \u2013 although he definitely isn\u2019t the elusive BARZ baron MC Double Mint \u2013 but does operate under the headband-donning, synth and bass impresario alias Opal Block, with a 12\" vinyl release due in 2014 through Astral Black records. \n \nDr Syntax \n\n\u201cA Banbury rap baritone with sounds smoother than a sanded egg\u201d \nAs a fresh faced teen in the early 00s, Dr Syntax packed a knapsack full of Big Daddy Kane, Wu Tang and Redman cassettes, and bid farewell to the lush Oxfordshire countryside, moving to Brighton to follow his ambition of making hip hop music. \nThis Slick Wittington rap pilgrimage soon bore fruit with Syntax becoming a prominent figure in the city's hip hop scene, winning various local battles, and forming The Menagerie with Professor Elemental, Tom Caruana and DJ Nick Maxwell.  \nShortly after the release of their debut album \u2013 'Wild Kingdom' in 2003, Syntax met the legendary Foreign Beggars, promptly appearing on their debut 'Asylum Speakers' on 2 tracks (What Goes Up and Glacial). He became a regular collaborator, appearing on their next 2 albums 'Stray Point Agenda' and 'United Colours of Beggatron', touring extensively with them at festivals including  Glastonbury festival and Hip Hop Kemp.  \nThe release of his next album 'Self Taught' brought Syntax critical acclaim, appearing in Hip Hop Connection's 'Top 100 UK hip hop albums of all time' list, and high profile support slots at this time included Slum Village, The Pharcyde, People Under The Stairs, Necro, KRS One and Wu Tang Clan.  \nAfter winning a UK heat of New York's legendary emcee competition 'End Of The Weak' in London in 2007, the release of second album 'Benny Huge' saw his first link with Pete Cannon, and following a move to Manchester, they have been performing live together ever since, including support slots for Ugly Duckling, Pharoahe Monch, and Chali 2na.  \nA Slice Of Fried Gold followed Benny Huge \u2013 conceived after Shaun Of The Dead director Edgar Wright sent producer Tom Caruana all the audio from his films dialogue with carte blanche to sample on the album. The pair gained vocal fans in both Wright and Simon Pegg in the process, with the former playing album track \u2018Universal\u2019 in a mix for BBC Radio 1.  \nIn 2013, Chart sensations Rizzle Kicks enlisted Syntax in an incredible  line-up for the posse cut remix of their hit single, \u2018Dreamers\u2019, alongside Ed Sheeran, Pharoahe Monch, Chali 2na, Professor Green OV (Foreign Beggars) and Hinesy Hines.  \nSyntax\u2019s more recent work with Manchester band The Mouse Outfit has put Syntax at the forefront of one of the most exciting unsigned acts in the country. The 9-piece band and emcee collective garnered massive support from the UK hip hop scene and further afield, touring extensively across the country and Europe, with their debut album Escape Music being featured by US News website ABC in their best worldwide albums of 2013.\n\nYou can download the mixtape 'Still At Large', mixed by DJ Woody, for free from www.drsyntax.bandcamp.com.\n\n\nJMAN, the verbally gifted, dreadlock sporting, baby faced charmer that has been compared to \u201cBlanka when charging up from streetfighter when he spits\u201d is a jack of all trades from Mcing/hosting Hip hop, Grime, Drum & Bass, Dubstep to producing, Dj\u2019ing and engineering.

Over the past couple years he's been all over the country and parts of Europe, drawing people in with immediate stage presence hitting you with conscious topics too vibrant comedy tracks and ending off with a surge of energetic madness using his notorious triple time flow that will leave you wanting more and more.\n\nJman is currently working on his debut Album \"Auranography\" featuring some of the U.K's finest and has released his first three singles \u201c4D Reality\u201d, \u201cAny point of the day\u201d & \u201cFather figures\u201d \n\nOver the years, Jman has hosted/Mc for: Skream, Benga, Artwork, Caspa, Rusko, Ntype, Kromestar, Coki, Distance, Hatcha, Terror Dainjah, Spooky, Spyro, Pantha, Cluekid, Lurka, Pinch, Redlight, Sukh Knight, Plastician, Wookie, Chase & status, Breakage, Chef, Komonazmuk, Reso, Joker, Mary Anne Hobbs, Doctor P, Trolley Snatcha, Funtcase, Flux Pavillion, 16 bit, Cookie monsta, Eddie K, The Others, Jakes, Chasing Shadows, Skizm, Scratch Perverts, Emalkay, Synkro, Kryptic Minds, Icicle, Benton, Unitz, Terrafonix, Jfb, Andy C, High Contrast, Shy FX, Alix Perez, DJ Fresh, Rockwell, Drumsound & bassline smith, Brookes bros, Original sin, Taxman, Wilkinson, Commix, N.Blackmarket, Crissy Criss, Benny Page, & more.\n\nHe then went on to perform his solo Hip hop/Grime here, there and everywhere being the support act for such artists as Immortal Technique, R.A the Rugged man, Afrika Bambaataa, Akil, Souls of Mischeif, DJ, Vadim, David Rodigan, Sha Stimuli, Rodney P, Taskforce, Skinnyman, Phi Life Cypher, Jehst, Klashnekoff, Micall Parkunsun, Foreign Beggars, Pmoney, Newham Generals, Lethal Bizzle & much more...\n\nYou can download his debut album 'Auranography' here\nhttp://greasyvinyl.bandcamp.com/album/auranography",

RINSE FM - LONDON U.K.\n\nALSO WITH...\n\nW1SHONE . MONIQUECOQUILLA . QUIXSLVR . MARKPLSTK \n\nUNWIND IS LOCATED AT BACK BAR\nFRIDAY MARCH 28 . 21+ . 9PM - 2AM . $10 DOOR\n\n---- \n\nSWINDLE\nBUTTERZ . DEEP MEDI . RINSE FM\nA man with a penchant for funk-fuelled productions with a grime twist, South-Londoner Swindle has firmly cemented his place on the UK\u2019s electronic music circuit over the last three years thanks to his psychedelic approach to anything he turns his hand to.\nTaking time to hone his craft through working with highly-revered UK artists such as Roll Deep, Chipmunk, Professor Green and Asher D, the producer began to focus his attention on solo instrumental productions with 2009\u2019s Curriculum Vitae album showcasing his interpretation of Grime and electronic music on the whole that falls in the 140 BPM template.\n \nHis work instantly grabbed the attention of Rinse FM DJ duo Elijah & Skilliam and soon after they gave his music a platform on their weekly radio show and further down the line their record label, Butterz. This led to heightened interest from the wider electronic music scene and spurned singles such as Airmiles (released via-Planet Mu) and Mood Swings (released via Butterz) which propelled him onto the DJ circuit where he has become a mainstay in clubs up and down the UK and Europe.\n\nThe 25-year old prides himself on a distinct sound that is rooted in Funk \u2013 from George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic to Roy Ayers he encapsulates the spirit of the sound in his work, whether it be the bass-heavy exploits of Pineapple or the intricate melodies on recent Deep Medi heavy hitter Do The Jazz.\n\n2012 has already seen Swindle release Ignition (which featured one half of Newham General\u2019s Footsie and Nadia Suliman) and Need To Know (co-produced with BBC Radio 1\u2019s Toddla T) that featured the Roger Troutman-esque vocals of Sam Frank. He\u2019s also teamed up with fellow Deep Medi artist Silkie on the production front with the single \u2018Unlimited\u2019 which finally saw the light of day on Butterz and their relationship promises to be a fruitful one if their back to back sets at seminal London club nights FWD and Butterz & Hardrive are anything to go by.\n\nShowing that he\u2019s no one-trick pony he\u2019s also been featured in Q Magazine where he featured on Amy Winehouse\u2019 Back To Black tribute compilation.  To commemorate the late-singer\u2019s debut album, Swindle teamed up with songstress Baby Sol and covered \u2018Some Unholy War\u2019 \u2013 managing to add his creative input to rework a track from one of his musical inspirations.\nThe road ahead for Swindle looks promising. With more diverse projects on Deep Medi to come as well as holding down his radio show on Rinse FM there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s carrying the torch for funk and has no intention of letting it die out anytime soon.",

Perc, label boss of the brilliant Perc Trax will be playing a special house set for the first time ever to help us celebrate the launch of HB004. An internationally renowned DJ, Perc regularly plays at some of the biggest and best clubs right across the world, alongside some of the best DJ\u2019s. Whilst he is known primarily for his techno, you should certainly not discount his knowledge of house music, with an ear for some incredible tracks we\u2019re so excited to hear what he brings to play.\n\nNext up is the man behind the EP, Enrico Mantini. A true pioneer of the deep house sound and a man who absolutely kills it every single time he plays for us. His releases on UMM in the nineties are still being played by DJ\u2019s all over the world and the reception we\u2019ve had of HB004 so far is no different! His signature, punchy, house sound can get the hands of any crowd up in the air - you can guarantee Enrico is going to get you dancing.\n\nHalf Baked resident Greg Brockmann is back! With us since the very beginning, Greg can always be relied on to entertain our beautiful London crowd. Now living in Berlin and providing music in some of the city\u2019s most renowned clubs such as Tresor, Hoppetosse and Arena Club he is fully deserved of where he is today and it is a great pleasure to have such a good DJ as one of our residents.\n\nFinally we have Eyesmoon or Thomas Gimenez as some of you may know him. A very close friend of the Half Baked Family, Thomas is originally from France but now living in London. As those of you who have seen him play before will know, he is an awesome DJ and he is definitely going to get you all warmed up perfectly for the rest of the night\u2019s festivities. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a guestlist only party so if you want to be part of it then please send your full names to: \nguestlist@halfbaked.org.uk\n\nPlease remember that being on the guestlist does not mean you will definitely get in to the party. We reserve the right to refuse entry to people with the wrong attitude. This does not mean that only regulars can get in... Even if you have never been to Half Baked before but you possess the right attitude, and are respectful of yourself and those around you, then you have nothing to worry about! \n\n\nHalf Baked Releases (Vinyl Only):\n\n- HB 004 - Enrico Mantini with \"Overflowing\" \nhttps://soundcloud.com/half-baked-records/sets/hb004-enrico-mantini - RELEASED IN MARCH\n\n- HB 003 - BirdsMakingMachine ( Fumiya Tanaka Remix) \nhttps://soundcloud.com/half-baked-records/sets/hb003-birdsmakingmachine \n\n- HB 002 - Mike Shannon with Slip it ( Thomas Melchior Remix) \nhttps://soundcloud.com/half-baked-records/sets/hb002-mike-shannon-east-side \n\n- HB 001- Various Artist with Seuil, Le Loup , Yakine & Robin Ordell\nhttps://soundcloud.com/half-baked-records/sets/preview-hb001-v-a-le-loup \n\n\nHalf Baked Records <3",

Questa delusione, lo ha portato a focalizzare tutte le sue forze sulla musica e sul djing, in modo da poter esprimere tutto se stesso.\n\nDopo aver vissuto per 6 mesi a Madrid nel 2003, e dopo aver esplorato la scena underground londinese, la scelta di fare il dj fu naturale. \n\nNel 2005-2008 Rossko diventa dj resident per Lost Souls, a Londra, party famoso per le feste diurne di sabato, presso il famigerato Public Life di Shoreditch. Qui perfeziona le sue qualit\u00e0 di dj, e le sue sonorit\u00e0.\n\nDedica tutto il suo tempo e la sua fatica cercando sonorit\u00e0 originali, ed arriva cos\u00ec ad esibirsi in diversi clubs di Londra, quali:\nThe Key, The Cross, Egg, Turnmills, Ministry of Sound, Cafe1001, East Village and Home bar.\nArrivano poi performance in: Birmingham, Manchester, Southampton, Liverpool e pi\u00f9 recentemente a Barcellona, Ibiza and Manheim, suonando al fianco di djs come: Loco Dice, Luciano, Nick Curly, Federico Molinari, H.O.S.H, Ray Okpara, Nima Gorji, Daniel Sanchez, Chris Liebing, Josh Wink, Tobi Neumann, Laidback Luke, Guy called Gerald, Tolga Fidan, Afrilounge, Men In Trees, Geddes.\n\nRossko \u00e8 ora dj resident al Cerca Trova, ed al Fuse a Londra. \n\nSTAY TUNED WITH US!\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/rossko\n\nhttp://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/rossko",

It is one of the largest LGBT+ Parades in the UK and your chance to show lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people from all over the UK, Europe and further afield the very best that London has to offer. The aim of the Parade is to have fun, campaign and ultimately showcase the LGBT+ community in London, the UK and overseas.\n\nWhen is the Parade and what time does it start?\n\nThe Parade takes place on Saturday 28 June 2014, commencing at 13:00.\n\nWhat is the Parade\u2019s route?\n\nThe Parade departs from Baker Street and the procession then follows this route:\n\n1) Straight down Orchard Street\n\n2) Turns left into Oxford Street and continues to Oxford Circus\n\n3) Turns right into Regent Street and continues to Piccadilly Circus\n\n4) Passing Eros, it then carries on down Lower Regent Street\n\n5) Turns left into Pall Mall and continues round to Cockspur Street, passing the south side of Trafalgar Square\n\n7) Round the roundabout into Whitehall.\n\nThe route is approximately just over two miles long. The route does not follow the normal traffic layout as the streets have been closed for Pride in London.\n\nWhere and when does the Parade finish?\n\nThe Parade finishes at Whitehall at approximately 16:30.\n\nWhat is the theme for the Parade?\n\nThe theme for this year\u2019s Parade is \u2019Freedom to\u2026\u2019. This can interpreted in any form that you like but we encourage you to to dress and decorate your float appropriately to represent your chosen subject.\n\nExamples are \u2018Freedom to marry\u2019 or \u2018Freedom to holiday\u2019, there are countless options open to you and is the ideal opportunity to demonstrate how far we have travelled, the goals left to achieve and to celebrate the invaluable contribution that the LGBT+ community makes to London today.\n\n- See more at: http://prideinlondon.org/parade-faqs/#sthash.oGRpcfca.dpuf",

        "description": "Grupo Niche is Colombia\u2019s most emblematic salsa orchestra who have conquered the world for more than thirty years with their Cali-style salsa. They recently released  the album Tocando el Cielo Con Las Manos, containing a bunch of potential hits and demonstrating that the band is still at the top of its game.\n\nGrupo Niche was formed by Jairo Varela and a group of like-minded, talented musicians and made their debut with the release of Al Pasito in 1980. After becoming one of the major tropical acts in their native country, the group had the opportunity to participate in a salsa festival at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden in 1986.  The band brought their dynamic sound to Europe for the first time in 1989. During the \u201990s, Grupo Niche turned to romantic lyrics, leaving behind their traditional songs based on social issues and had numerous hits such as \u201cAna Mil\u201d, \u201cLa Canoa Rancha\u201d \u2018 Cali Aji\u201d, \u201d Una Aventura\u201d \u2018 Cielo de Tambores\u201d, \u201d Gotas de Lluvia\u201d and \u201d Cali Pachanguero\u201d. Richie Valdez is the new musical director and Grupo Niche is alive as ever. To close La LInea 2014 the band will present their new work (including their summer hit \u201cUn d\u00eda despu\u00e9s\u201d ) and all the old favourites from the golden age of Colombian salsa.\n\nSupported by a top line-up of London\u2019s finest Colombian salsa djs to keep you dancing to the madrugada.\n\nTickets \u00a326 plus booking fee\n\nBUY TICKETS ONLINE\n\nVia venue: http://www.seetickets.com/event/la-linea-presents-grupo-niche-djs/electric-brixton/756380\n\nTicket Web: http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/event/97695\n\nSongkick: https://tickets.songkick.com/events/18920929",

Mashing up hip hop with baile funk, trap and Afro-Brazilian beats, Karol Conka\u2019s sound is a uniquely Brazilian mix. Batuque just got freaked.\n\nWinner of the 2013 Multishow Best New Artist award, with over 2 million views of her video singles (Boa Noite also features on the FIFA 2014 EA game) and a blazing collaboration with Buraka Som Sistema for Adidas, Karol Conka is now set to take on the world with the international release of her debut album on Mr Bongo Records.\n\nKaroline dos Santos Oliveira, aka Karol Conka, first set foot on stage in her home-town Curitiba in southern Brazil aged just 17. Ten years later, the young MC has proved that she has what it takes to be one of the most distinctive voices from today\u2019s high-grade Brazilian hip hop scene.\n\nOne of the very few female Brazilian hip hop artists to break out of the underground, Karol Conka\u2019s wider success was kicked off by the 2011 single Boa Noite (nominated for an MTV Brazil award). With the Brazilian launch of the album via VICE magazine, downloads and shows across the country, the rapper, singer and songwriter \u2013 influenced by Brazilian Pop Music (MPB) and a big Azealia Banks fan \u2013 has gained national recognition and critical acclaim. Hugely respected by her peers, she has also shared the stage with rap pioneers Racionais MCs, hip-hop hero Criolo and label-mate Marcelo D2, as well as recording with major rap star Projota and samba veteran Luiz Melodia.\n\nTickets \u00a311 plus booking fee\n\nBUY TICKETS ONLINE:\n\n> Ticketmaster:\nhttp://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/partner_redirect?v=WNs81SVicGTOifC-1AZGUDquodUCmc81-OMa72fedEq1-QAx6L9v6Yp_EleqWttbyeLbhzXJAWGsluu0G7uX7K_M-w81VdZFzPtiSt6ekDEN--4hseW6cBw3O8LeqT1x3Na_G0oLaEI5CIvU&eventid=32004C45E9AC64DE&artistid=5126363&artistname=Karol%20Conka\n\n> Ticket Web: http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/checkout/event.php?eventId=GMC0304\n\n> See Tickets:  http://www.seetickets.com/event/karol-conka-la-linea/concrete/768768\n\n> Songkick: https://tickets.songkick.com/events/19472954",

        "description": "2 day Weekend seminar that will rejuvenate your salah.\nFor Brothers and Sisters \n\nThe prayer of the believer is the single most important form of worship and means of connection with one\u2019s Lord. It is the medium through which the believer literally speaks to Allah and the a fountain from which one drinks on a daily basis to reinvigorate the soul and re establish one\u2019s purpose in life.\n\nI don\u2019t know about you, but the above description of the prayers sounds somewhat alien to most of us right? The question is why? What\u2019s missing and how can we make a change to revive the ritual?\n\nThis course seeks to address this very question\u2026\n\nThis course will:\n\n- Share the secret of how to attain khushu (concentration & devotion) in the prayer\n- Explain both the outward and inward meanings of all the utterances in the prayer\n- Explain the significance of the physical motions in the prayer\n- Describe the thoughts & emotions one should experience in an awakened prayer\n- Provide practical advice on how to develop the prayer through the above\n\n\n\nTeachers: \nShaykh Shams Adduha Muhammad \nShaykh Mujahid Ali \nShaykh Abdur Rahman Anwar \nShaykh Abu Aaliyah - Surkheel Sharif\n\nExtensive coursenotes will be provided for free\n\nNote: this is not a fiqh course. The focus is on the quality of prayer as opposed to the rules of prayer.",

        "description": "So....these past few years ehhh....they have been testing to say the least, but i managed to pull it all off pretty well  Got the Girl of my Dreams, Played at some of the most Momentous Parties i have ever attended, let alone get the privilege to play at, i've met some Wonderful People, and i've also lost some......, but as they say, 'It's all part of God's eternal plan..', whether it's fair or not, we all have our destiny, and destiny is nature's law.\n\nMeet my Godson, he's a bright, bubbly little man who never fails to make me grin, but through that beautiful smile, he's having to endure hour's of physiotherapy because he finds it hard to move around on his own, also he has to labour through countless test's and other investigations and he's not even fully developed yet, at this point although things weren't perfect for me future wise, at least i had my health and the hope that anything was possible.\n\nAt this very moment, he's a little too young for us to know the full extent of his condition, but, until then he has to go abroad (Because its going to be major cheaper than here!) to receive quality therapy, which hopefully will allow him the very best start in life that he can be given, but this can cost an astronomical amount of money, much more than any new family could possibly afford in the modern day UK, and i gotta say i salute his parents who are very good friends of mine.\n\nI have over the past few months, been kinda feeling sorry for myself with regards to a fair few things, but tonight, i had what you might call an epiphany, and that is this, if you live your life in the past, your past will destroy you, make no mistake about that, the key is to not live either in the past, or to hope for the future, but is simply to be happy for what you have now, the present, as that is all you have ever had in the first place.\n\nI have been changing my life around, living healthier and removing the poisons in my life (Well most of em!lol), aspiring to the more meaningful and precious aspects of my world, and i am from here on in going to make every second count, trust me on this!! \n\nSo, i would just like to say, every penny made by any of my tracks or remixes of the next year, i will be donating to my little corner of the fund to help him over the pond for his treatment and anything else i can possibly help with, plus i will be doing the 'Electric Run' in London in April to also raise a bit to try and help him along, and this is where you can help, please visit my justgiving page and if you feel you can help, sponsor me to help Luka's cause, any amount, no matter how small, can go a long way to helping him start to try and normal happy and healthy life.\n\nLink to JustGiving page: https://www.justgiving.com/yimby/godfatherfund\n\nLink to Electric Run Page:- http://electricrun.co.uk/\n\n\nI am thinking, i might be going on a mission this year for the greater good and your support would be, as always, very welcome  .\n\nGod bless you :) \n\nCarl xx",

        "description": "De plek waar Blur, The Libertines en The Kooks begonnen. Komende editie op vrijdag 9 en zaterdag 10 mei in Paradiso.\n\nIn 2014 gaat London Calling alweer zijn 22e jaargang in. Het festival dat in Paradiso wordt georganiseerd biedt een plek voor nieuw en opkomend talent uit Engeland, Amerika en ver daarbuiten. Op de voorgaande edities boekten niemand minder dan Blur, Placebo, The Libertines, The Kooks, Bloc Party hun eerste successen. In 2013 waren onder meer Jagwar Ma, MS MR, London Grammar, Palma Violets en Unknown Mortal Orchestra te gast op het halfjaarlijkse festival.\n\n------------------\nBEVESTIGD\n\nVrijdag 9 mei: \n\nJungle - Wolf Alice - Menace Beach \u2013 Eyedress - The Proper Ornaments - Folly and the Hunter \u2013 Hospitality \u2013 Teleman  - Happyness - The John Steel Singers e.a.\n\nZaterdag 10 mei:\n\n Royal Blood - Arthur Beatrice - Wild Cub - Ryan Keen \u2013 Gambles \u2013Telegram - Desperate Journalist \u2013 Childhood \u2013 Bohicas - Public Access T.V. \u2013 Solids - The Delta Riggs - The Neighbourhood e.a.\n\n------------------\nDesperate Journalist uit Londen heeft misschien nog geen langspeler uit, maar de vier nummers die online zijn uitgebracht werden wel meteen opgemerkt door de Britse en Amerikaanse muziekblogs. Spannende post-punk met pittige vrouwelijke vocalen, denk Siouxsie and the Banshees, Savages, Bleached. Overtuigend, krachtig en live ongetwijfeld een sensatie.\n\nWolf Alice was d\u00e9 Britse hype van 2013. Geen blog dat er niet over schreef. Het Nederlands livedebuut beleefde Wolf Alice op London Calling in de Tolhuistuin, waar de reacties lovend waren.De muziek van Wolf Alice is sprankelend, spannend en gruizig. Ergens tussen het fluisterwerk van Mazzy Star en de lo-fi klanken van Pavement en The Fall in. \n\nArthur Beatrice uit Londen maakt mysterieuze, minimale popmuziek \u2013 een beetje zoals The xx, maar meer indie dan electronisch \u2013 en ze staan op het punt om internationaal door te breken. De band heeft een frontman en frontvrouw: Orlando Leopard en de sierlijke Ella Girardot. De ritmesectie wordt bezet door de broers Elliot en Hamish Barnes.\n\nElliott Hammond, toetsenist van Wolfmother, is de frontman van The Delta Riggs. Deze band uit Sydney maakt pure rock \u2019n roll, met invloeden uit 70\u2019s psychedelica en hardrock. Het nummer \u2018Hex.Lover.Killer.\u2019 is een heerlijk aanstekelijk rock \u2019n roll anthem voor fans van Wolfmother, Jet, Cage The Elephant, The Hives.\n\nIce Choir. Pet Shop Boys, Erasure, Spandau Ballet,  Visage, Johnny Hates Jazz, Tears for Fears en dat dan door de drummer van Pains Of Being Pure At Heart dan heb je Ice Choir. Het project van Kurt Feldman -want zo heet hij  - is een ode aan de jaren  tachtig. Gladde Synths, barokke vocalen, romantische teksten en een hitsige drumbeat. \n\nDe muziek van Proper Ornaments is te omschrijven als perfecte indiepopmuziek, minimalistisch en klassiek, aanstekelijk en tijdloos. The Velvet Underground en Jesus & Mary Chain, maar dan iets meer gepolijst en moderner, zoals ook Jacco Gardner dat aanpakt. Proper Ornaments tourde in 2013 met Crystal Stilts en is op dit moment bezig met het eerste studioalbum. \n\nAmber Papini is de spil van de New Yorkse indieband Hospitality. Ze is een eigenaardige zangeres en songschrijver met een typisch Brits accent, maar dan met een Texaans tintje en haar liedjes getuigen van een enorme muzikale verbeeldingskracht. Tegendraadse indie. Vrolijk met een scherp toontje. Ze zou zo het derde zusje van Kim en Kelley Deal kunnen zijn. Het debuutalbum \u2018Trouble\u2019 komt zeer binnenkort uit.\n\nGambles is Matthew Daniel Siskin uit New York: hij maakt prachtige, ontroerende folkpopliedjes die veel gevoelens, emoties en tragedies verbergen. Op zijn debuutalbum \u2018Trust\u2019 is hij te horen als kalme zanger met akoestische gitaar. Hij laat zich niet omschrijven als eenzame troubadour, maar als getalenteerde folkzanger die zijn verhalen wil vertellen, en waar we nog veel van gaan horen.\n\nSan Fermin laat wervelende orkestrale chamberpop met allerlei stemmen en arrangementen op een natuurlijke manier samenkomen. De band werd opgericht in Brooklyn, door Ellis Ludwig-Leone. Na zijn studie aan Yale University raakte ze bevriend met Nico Muhly (Sufjan Stevens, Grizzly Bear) met wie hij zijn eerste composities schreef. Pas in 2013 werd het eerste werk onder de naam San Fermin uitgebracht: het debuutalbum \u2018San Fermin\u2019 werd met maar liefst 22 muzikanten opgenomen en is een sterke kennismaking met de band. \n\nMenace Beach is een ware indiesupergroep, bestaande uit o.a. Matt Johnson van Hookworms, Rob Lee van Pulled Apart By Horses, Nestor Matthews van Sky Larkin, Paul Draper van Mansun en Matt Spalding van You Animals. Menace Beach brengt allerlei alternatieve stijlen samen in zijn muziek: 90\u2019s grunge, Madchester Britpop, shoegaze, en fuzzy noiserock. Een krachtig en opwindend geheel, voortgebracht door enkele grootheden uit de hedendaagse indiescene.\n\nAls een ruimtemannetje zou vragen hoe ziet een indieband eruit? Dan kun je het beste een foto van de Britse band Telegram laten zien. En ook de muziek zou een perfecte inleiding zijn in het genre. Licht psychedelische gitaren, achternagezeten drums, bezwerende zang en verslavende refreinen. Zelf noemt de band het bootgaze. \u201cLots of people try and call it psych-rock or shoegaze, but\u2026 I mean, we just wear boots \u2013 bootgaze!\u201d. \n\nChildhood is een band uit London die hypnotiserende pop maakt en op het punt van doorbreken staat. Zomers, catchy, maar met een goed scherp randje. NME is groot fan en schrijft: \u201cA pinch of Creation Records shoegaze, a fistful of Sarah Records jangle, some baggy swagger and the right mix of laconic dreaminess and croon-along hooks\u201d. \n\nSolids is een Canadees duo dat met veel enthousiasme rockmuziek maakt, ge\u00efnspireerd door Dinosaur Jr., Sonic Youth en Superchunk. Oftewel: melodieuze grungerock met een flinke laag aan distortion en feedback effecten. \u2018Blame Confusion\u2019 is het debuutalbum dat afgelopen oktober werd uitgebracht bij Fat Possum Records (The Black Keys, Iggy and the Stooges).\n\nJungle is een Brits duo dat vorig jaar doorbrak met de single \u2018Platoon\u2019. De ongooglebare band schopte het met dit lied tot de BBC Sound Of 2014 lijst en sindsdien gaat het razendsnel met deze hype. Noem het indiefunk, urban tribal, wereldsoul: het is in ieder geval fris , hip, swingend en verslavend.\n\nRoyal Blood klinkt als een grote gitaarrockband maar is een hip duo zonder gitaar. Onvoorstelbaar  maar waar. Zanger-bassist Mike Kerr en drummer Ben Thatcher uit Brighton zorgen samen voor dit kunststukje. Bikkelhard, onverwoestbaar, met een muur van geluid en zonder enige concessie overstuurde de band reeds twee singles de wereld in die beiden insloegen als een bom. \n\n\u201cNew York\u2019s Hottest New Band\u201d, aldus NME: Public Access T.V. heeft met de single \u2018Monaco\u2019 de hype flink aangewakkerd. De band maakt springerige, strakke indierock die direct doet denken aan The Strokes. Afgelopen januari speelde zij pas de allereerste show; vers van de pers dus. Veel is er over Public Acces TV nog niet bekend, maar dat maakt de buzz rondom het jonge drietal des te groter. Absoluut niet te missen op London Calling.\n\nThe Bohicas is een talentvolle Britse band die intelligente gitaarmuziek maakt vol verrassende wendingen, hooks en catchy refreintjes. De band is getekend door Domino Records die reeds de opwindende debuutsingle \u2018XXX/Swarm\u2019 uitbracht. Muzikaal en qua ambitie zit de band ergens tussen labelgenoten Franz Ferdinand en Arctic Monkeys in. En die werden ook snel heel groot.\n\nTeleman is een Londens trio dat uit de as van Pete and the Pirates is herrezen. Toen het heel stil werd rond deze indieband lieten de leden Thomas Sanders, Jonny Sanders en Pete Cattermoul weten verder te gaan onder de naam Teleman. Met z\u2019n drie\u00ebn maken ze prachtige pop met veel samenzang en wonderschone melodie\u00ebn. Denk aan Django Django en Alt-J met \u201couderwetse\u201d invloeden van The Beach Boys en The Velvet Underground.\n\nDe singer-songwriter Ryan Keen is een artiest die een mooie warme stem heeft, een virtuoos gitarist is en hitgevoelige liedjes schrijft. De jonge Brit klinkt met zijn band eigenlijk een beetje alsof Ray Lamontagne bij Coldplay zingt. Kan wel eens een grote popster worden die Ryan Keen. Het debuutalbum \u2018Room For Light\u2019 is uit.\n\nKins, verantwoordelijk voor dromerige, gitaargedreven popmuziek, werd in 2010 opgericht door frontman Thomas Savage. De band uit Brighton balanceert op het randje van psychedelica met hun uitgesponnen liedjes van meer dan vijf minuten, maar klinkt tegelijkertijd fris, daadkrachtig en bescheiden.\n\nDe muziekscene uit Montreal is op zijn hoogtepunt: Arcade Fire, Patrick Watson, Grimes, en natuurlijk Folly and the Hunter. Deze veelbelovende folkgroep bracht in 2013 \u2018Tragic Care\u2019 uit en is sindsdien niet meer te stoppen. Melodieuze folk met veel ruimte voor sfeer, arrangementen en eigenaardige geluidjes. \n\nEentje om in de gaten te houden, deze \u201cbedroom-producer\u201d Eyedress. Dit is het project van de 23-jarige Idris Vicuna (gitarist van Bee Eyes). In zijn soloproject kan hij zijn electronische klanken kwijt: langzame beats, galmende vocalen en een beetje new wave. Heerlijk om eindeloos bij weg te dromen.\n\nFans van Cut Copy, Django Django en Crystal Fighters opgelet: hier is Wild Cub. \u2018Thunder Clatter\u2019 is de single die wereldwijd de radio\u2019s overnam. Tropisch, opzwepend en bij vlagen een beetje melancholisch zoals New Order of The Cure. \n\n'Sweater Weather' is de veel gedraaide single van de band The Neighbourhood uit Californi\u00eb. Dit nummer is een flinke hit aan het worden. In eigen land heeft \u2018Sweater Weather\u2019 het reeds geschopt tot de nummer 1 positie in de Billboard's Alternative Charts en nu is de rest van de wereld aan de beurt. De single staat op het debuutalbum \u2018I Love You\u2019 dat vol staat met deze hitgevoelige indie. Donker en duister met een fris hip randje.\n\n\nThe John Steel Singers uit Brisbane, Australi\u00eb maken melancholische, urgente indierock. Deze nieuwkomers kunnen niets verkeerd doen bij fans van Broken Social Scene, Deerhunter  en Cloud Control. De muziek wordt door de zesmansformatie vrolijk aangekleed door spannende arrangementen en blazers. Optimistisch, opgewekt en luchtig. \u2018Everything\u2019s A Thread\u2019 is het debuutalbum dat zojuist is uitgebracht.\n\nDatum: vrijdag 9 en zaterdag 10 mei 2014\nPrijs: \u20ac20,00 dagkaart en \u20ac35,00 passe-partout excl. lidm.

I felt as if they were part of me, as a woman, a mother and a musician.\n\nI had to make this record to be loyal to the present\u2026.

We have curated numerous amazing festival stages annually from Glastonbury's Shangri La to Bestival's Spiegeltent, and we continue to promote sell-out UK shows by bands like Parov Stelar and Caravan Palace.

Doors open at 9:30pm.\n\nCelebrating 18 years of Hospital Records!\n\nFirst up, a little history lesson... The first ever Hospitality event took place at Herbal way back in 2001. After five years of monthly shindigs at the East end sweatbox, Hospitality took the giant leap to super club Heaven for quarterly parties, which instantly became the stuff of legend. With Hospital Records artists like High Contrast, London Elektricity, Danny Byrd and Cyantific the stars of the show, and playing host to special guests such as Andy C, Fabio & Grooverider, DJ Marky, Noisia, Teebee and Calyx, Hospitality @ Heaven revolutionised and revived drum & bass in the capital. Matter at the O2 Arena became our new home in 2008 and after nine completely sold out parties at the Greenwich institution it was time to move on again! 2010 marked the beginning of a new era for the London event, as Hospitality took over the O2 Academy in Brixton, where we still to this day showcase spectacular line ups to the masses.\n\nWe are celebrating Hospital Records 18th birthday next year, so in honour of this milestone we are taking an emotional trip down memory lane by revisiting iconic venues across London that have helped to make Hospitality events what they are today.\n\nFebruary 7th we head up to Building Six at the O2 in North Greenwich. Memories of hosting parties at the O2 stretch back to 2008, when we began our 2-year residency at superclub Matter, where each & every show was a sold-out, unmissable experience. Fast forward to today & we are returning to the O2 to brand new venue Building Six, where we will be bringing a world class lineup, soundsystem and atmosphere... as standard.\n\nThen on May 4th we will be stepping even further back into the history books for a one-off spectacular at our beloved Heaven \u2013 a maze of dancefloors, bars and sound systems located under the arches of Charing Cross station in the heart of central London, a nightclub engraved on the heart of British rave culture. Those who remember the original Hospitality events at Heaven will know these were really special occasions, and we aim to recapture that vibe in 2014 with the best artists and the friendliest crowd. And for those who never made it to Heaven all those years ago, this is your chance to experience an integral piece of Hospitality history.\n\nBoth events promise to be something to saviour, completely unique whilst including everything you love about Hospitality.\n\nTo join us on our journey, simply follow the links below (or the \"Get Tickets\" link above) & we'll see you on the dancefloor!\n\nBuilding Six - Feb 7:\nSOLD OUT\n\nHeaven - May 4:\nSOLD OUT\n \nx",

Applications will be accepted from all styles and forms of art, from artists working in any medium, from any location in the world.\n\nConcept\nThe Modern Panic exhibitions are inspired by the work of the original Panic Movement, which was comprised of artists Alejandro Jodorowsky, Fernando Arrabal and Roland Topor, who created provocative live arts events in France during 1960s.

Accantonati i monotoni impegni e le incombenze dell\u2019inizio, tutti si ritrovano e si perdono nella notte pi\u00f9 esclusiva della settimana. La Night Life romana \u00e8 finalmente competitiva nella scena off mondiale grazie a VEGA e al suo ANY GIVEN MONDAY. Un luned\u00ec per pochi. Scorretto, insolito, non convenzionale, caratterizzato dalle esuberanti sonorit\u00e0 vintage dell\u2019indie-rock e dalle afose rotondit\u00e0 dell\u2019electro. Qualcuno dica a Bob Geldof che ormai \u201cI don\u2019t like mondays\u201d \u00e8 un\u2019affermazione superata.\n\nL\u2019ANY GIVEN MONDAY si discosta, sia esteticamente che concettualmente, dai canoni usuali del divertimento notturno. \u00c8 un format-party \u201cglocale\u201d che importa elementi esterofili all\u2019avanguardia, personalizzandoli notevolmente, e riadattandoli alla realt\u00e0 off capitolina.\n\n\u00c8 una festa MADE AT HOME, spiazzante per la sua diversit\u00e0, dove l\u2019imperativo non \u00e8 apparire, ma divertirsi. \u00c8 un happening, un carnevale perenne, \u00e8 musica, teatro, danza, arte, moda, video, televisione, avanspettacolo e molto, ma molto di pi\u00f9, del prodotto che si ottiene moltiplicando tutti questi fattori tra di loro. \u00c8 un posto incantato, fuori dal tempo e dallo spazio, veramente FREE e OPEN. \u00c8 un contenitore difficile da descrivere dove c\u2019\u00e8 tutto e il contrario di tutto, sempre uguale ma in continuo mutamento.\n\nL\u2019ANY GIVEN MONDAY \u00e8 un party dall\u2019animo sensibile, il vestito vintage, l\u2019aspetto kitsch e il cuore naif, con uno sguardo avanguardistico e una straordinaria capacit\u00e0 di prendersi in giro e prendere in giro una citt\u00e0 tanto seria come Roma. \u00c8 controcorrente e retr\u00f2, ma sempre contemporaneo e attuale, pieno di vizi e stravaganze.\n\n\u00c8 stato indubbiamente la pluripremiata novit\u00e0 degli ultimi anni, definito da molti addetti ai lavori un \u201casso piglia tutto che non pu\u00f2 non piacere\u201d, aristocratico e popolare, raffinato e cafone, fa delle sue contraddizioni e delle sue divergenze il suo pi\u00f9 grande pregio. All\u2019AGM ci sono tutti! Gente di ogni tipo: persone diversissime tra di loro e di tutte le parti del mondo che magicamente ballano, saltano e si divertono insieme.\n\nIl suo essere off e casalingo \u00e8 diventato in breve tempo di massa, la sua irruzione nel panorama della night life romana \u00e8 stata come quella di un uragano, che ha cambiato le regole del gioco, spazzando via consuetudini decennali e modificando il concetto stesso di divertimento. Per questi e mille altri motivi l\u2019ANY GIVEN MONDAY \u00e8 gi\u00e0 mito, ma nonostante tutto rimane quello che \u00e8 sempre stato: un party controcorrente e all\u2019occasione contro anche se stesso, una festicciola tra amici nel salone di casa dove ognuno porta qualche cosa e ci si ritrova a conoscersi tutti.\n\nL\u2019AGM oggi piu' che mai rimane MADE AT HOME, OFF, CHEAP e OPEN rappresentando in festa l\u2019essenza stessa del luned\u00ec. L\u2019AGM \u00e8 un posto magico: la casa di tutti e il party di tutti nato sotto la buona stella di VEGA, custodito dai dentoni del giaguaro e abitato da sempre nuovi e strabilianti personaggi in cerca d\u2019autore.\n\nPROGRAMMA\n\nSTAGE JOHNNY (2nd FLOOR)\n\nH22.30 START\nH23.01 DISCOUNT\nH00.01 STACEY MALIBU'\nH01.01 EDO PIETROGRANDE (D:VISION)\nH02.01 MOKAI\nH04.31 STOP\n\n_______________________________________________________\n\nSTAGE JAGUAR (1st FLOOR)\n\n22.30 START\n23.30 KIN 8\n00.45 STEFANO GAMMA\n03.01 ROMEO RODEO\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nSTAGE SKULL (1st FLOOR)\n23.30 START\n00.00 RENE V.\n01.15 LECANER\n02.30 ESOX\n04.00 STOP\n__________________________________________________________\n\nSTAGE ROXANNE (GROUND FLOOR)\n\n22.30 START\n23.30 BARBY DJ\n00.45 BAL DORIA (WOOOW!)\n02.15 JOE DOMINGUEZ & LONDON PRIDE\n04.00 STOP\n___________________________________________________________\n\nGIANNY'S present: \n\nLONDON SHOW with GIANNY' UNITED TEAM & DOUBLE L directed by DYANA GRAVINA.\n\nNel corso del dj set \u00e8 prevista una mirabolante CIRCUS PERFORMANCE di INERZIA.ORG\n\ngrouping & modeling LONDON shows by GIANNY'S\n\nOn Stage DOUBLE L, DYANA & HER GIRRRLZ.\n\nPhoto shooting show di DANNY BALE, EMMECI QUADRO e GIORGIO IALONGO & JPIG\n\n2nd Room: UNIVERSAL EXPO ART - OPEN ART\n\nMostra collettiva pittura, fotografia, installazione.\n\nON THE LEDGE : \"MONDIAL WRITERS WARS\", a cura di Ivan Fornari\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nMARKET AREA: The Market Exchange\n\nAll\u2019interno del locale verr\u00e0 inoltre allestito uno spazio dove alcuni fra i partecipanti pi\u00f9 originali e insoliti della serata potranno essere immortalati in fascinose foto formato polaroid.\n\nOFFICIAL SPONSOR\n\nDOCSITY\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Docsity.com - L'universit\u00e0, condivisaedia partners\n\non sserts, astrazioni studio, visual lab\n\nONE SHOT ONE EURO ALL NIGHT LONG\n\ninfo\n\nwww.anygivenmonday.it\nwww.myspace.com/anygivenmondayroma\nwww.facebook.com/anygivenmonday\nmobile 3288640362",

Born and raised in Sicily, but now residing in Kingston, Jamaica, the multi-instrumentalist Alborosie\u2019s music career began with forming his own band Reggae National Tickets (signed to BMG Italia), at the age of 15.\n \nAfter multiple sold-out tours, the Italian artist with a Reggae pedigree decided to make a move to Jamaica to be close to reggae music's roots and Rastafari culture and begin his solo career.\n\nIn 2011, he became the first white artist to win a MOBO (Music of Black Origin) Award in the Best Reggae Act category.\n\nAfter a successful tour throughout South America and Europe in 2013; performing on re-nowned stages such as Montreux Jazz Festival, Solidays, Garorock, Dour Festival, Summerjam, Rototom, to mention a few, Alborosie and his Jamaican backing band Shengen Clan have built a huge following worldwide and have shared the stage with some of the worlds biggest international Reggae artists.\n\nWell-known for his unbelievable energy during live shows, Alborosie starts the year at top speed and is excited to be performing in the UK for the first time. \n\nTo date, Alborosie has worked with credible artists such as Mario, Angie Stone, Jewel, Sisqo, No Doubt, Wyclef and Les Nubians.  He has also collaborated with All-stars Dean Frazer, Beenie Man, Lutan Fya and a number of other Jamaican artists. \n\nMr. FASO (Rootikal) - www.mrfaso.com\n\nBRIXTON HEIGHTS CREW - http://www.mixcloud.com/brixtonheights3/\n\nSupported by THTC Eco Clothing - www.thtc.co.uk\n\nThis is strictly an 18 + show.\n\nFor any more info don't hesitate to write us on:\ndario@goforwardevents.co.uk\ngiulio@goforwardevents.co.uk",

House Dance allows for the socialization and the language of dance to be shared between friends, adversaries, strangers, enthusiasts, and dancers of many styles.  It trains and develops both a sense of dance vocabulary, but also body kinetics and alignment, power generation, control, inflection, emotional content, and variable timing and structure.  From contemporary dancer to hard core battle gladiator, the language of house dance applies to all.  \n\nWe will fire through a host of vocabulary, applications and variations.  Then we will apply them as per various situations, tactics and strategies.  Throughout we will develop understandings as to how the dance works and why we would make various movement choices and give a path to further exploration.  \n\nAll are welcome as we look forward to helping your dance story be told... leggo.",

We are not sure when the rates will change so please get your first payment in soon to be locked in at the rates above and insure your seats are with the initial group.\n\nTRAVEL INSURANCE:\nTravel Insurance Policy Based on 2 travelers $3200 package total Gold Trip Cancellation Trip Interruption Specific to injury, sickness, or death $500,000 emergency medical transportation $25,000 medical $1,000 baggage loss $300.00 baggage delay $750.00 trip delay $250.00 missed connection Policy Rates are based on age for two people $220.00 aged 40 and younger $290.00 aged 60 and younger\n\nPREPARING FOR OUR INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT TO LONDON:\nOur flight will leave Atlanta on October 21 and will not arrive in London until October 22. If you do not live in Atlanta, I strongly suggest you fly into Atlanta on October 20 and spend the night at a hotel near Hartfield-Jackson International Airport. It will cut out the risk of missing flights and will also give you a sense of peace knowing that you are near the airport where your international flight will depart. We will meet up and have a nice going away reception in The Hospitality Suite at the Airport before we board the plane. For those that want to really start off right, I suggest a p.j. party the night before so we are all together and go to the airport together and know we all have everything needed for the trip.\n\nPASSPORT:\nYou MUST have a passport for this event. Your passport must not expire within six months of your travel to London (passport cannot expire before March 21, 2015). No Visa is required for US Citizens.",

The biggest social and cultural revolutions appeared through new symbolizations of hair. Women were shaving their hair to refuse the power of men and men were growing hair as the feminine countercultural refusal of patriarchal societies. Last but not least growing beards happens to be the contemporary queer phenomenon to desymbolize masculine identities.",

        "description": "After a whirlwind couple of year\u2019s Gaby Moreno won the Latin Grammy for best new artist in November 2013. Born and raised in Guatemala, she started listening to blues, r&b and soul at a young age. Singers like Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Simone and Aretha Franklin inspired her to take on singing herself.\n\nA little over 10 years ago, Gaby moved to Los Angeles, USA and after winning \u201dJohn Lennon Songwriting Contest\u201d in 2006, she released her debut album Still The Unknown in 2008. Later that year she was asked to write the theme song for NBC\u2019s \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d (co-written with Vincent Jones), that was nominated for an Emmy Award. Latina Magazine acclaimed her \u201dBest New Latin Artist 2010\u2033, and she was the support act for both Ani DiFranco\u2019s and Tracy Chapman\u2019s world tours in 2009 and 2010. Also in 2010, she participated in one of the most prestigious and long time rock festivals in Denmark, Roskilde, where she emotively sang in front of 17,000 people accompanied by the Youth Radio Symphony of Denmark, directed by the legendary pianist, composer, producer and Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks. The next year without any push or support from a label, her independently released second album llIustrated Songs reached #1 in sales on Latin Itunes and Amazon Latin. That led her to many concerts in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nIn 2012, Gaby Moreno entered into the Latin-American music scene, thanks to the invitation extended by her fellow countryman and one of the most successful Latin American artists of all time, Ricardo Arjona, to record the duet \u201cFuiste Tu\u201d. The song won wide approval with a Latin audience as well as two Latin Grammy nominations for \u201cSong of The Year\u201d and \u201cRecording Of The Year\u201d. Subsequently Gaby released her third album Postales which retains the same swing as her previous records but is sung completely in Spanish.\n\nIn 2013, she recorded a duet with Hugh Laurie, for his new album Didn\u2019t It Rain, a cover of the popular song \u201cKiss Of Fire\u201d and Gaby has been touring the world with Hugh Laurie and the Copper Bottom Band.\n\n\u201cThe Guatemalan songwriter Gaby Moreno plucked ragtimey syncopations on a well-worn acoustic guitar, and let loose a tangy, bluesy voice with the feistiness of \u00c9dith Piaf.\u201d- NY Times\n\n\u201cMoreno\u2019s breathtaking voice is passionate and stylistically malleable, as she glides back and forth easily between bossa nova and bluesy rock.\u201d- NPR Tiny Desk\n\n\u201cGaby Moreno\u2019s soulful vocals and ability to switch languages and genres have made her a rising star.\u201d \u2013 NPR All Things Considered\n\nTickets \u00a315 plus booking fee\n\nBUY TICKETS ONLINE\nVia venue: https://uk.patronbase.com/_RM/Seats/NumSeats?prod_id=AW01&perf_id=1&section_id=BAR&seat_type_id=S\n\nTicketmaster: http://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/gaby-moreno-london-04-04-2014/event/35004B8AE87F4FCF?artistid=1714331&majorcatid=10001&minorcatid=5\n\nTicket Web: http://www.ticketweb.co.uk/event/gaby-moreno-tickets/97671\n\nSee Tickets: http://www.seetickets.com/event/gaby-moreno/rich-mix/756651",

Damals noch im \"Club Reina\" der sich auf der Rheinseite des Walzm\u00fchlcenters in Ludwigshafen befindet. Das Geb\u00e4ude ist absolut Kult. Die Legend\u00e4ren Hallen der alten Walzm\u00fchle waren damals gef\u00fcllt mit Topp Bookings der Techno-Szene. Selbst die \"Time Warp \" wurde in den 90ern dort gegr\u00fcndet!  \n\nhttp://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walzm%C3%BChle \n\n20 G\u00e4ste hatten wir bei der 1. Veranstaltung auf dem 2.  Floor der Location :D.  \"minimal\" & \"techhouse\" bestimmten die Line Up\u00b4s s\u00e4mtlicher Clubs. Mit \"Tumult & Kult\" sollte sich dies \u00e4ndern. Die Reihe fing schnell an Anh\u00e4nger zu finden.  \n\nIm April 2012 sind wir dann wegen Schlie\u00dfung des \"Reina\" in den damals gerade wieder neu-er\u00f6ffneten \"Club London\" gezogen.\n\nIm Juni 2012 stieg dann bei \"Tumult & Kult\" mit \"NIEREICH TECHNO LIVE\" im London die erste richtig fette Technoparty mit Headlinerbooking... Der Laden ist eskaliert und die Region wurde mit der Leidenschaft f\u00fcr Techno entfacht die selbst drei Jahre sp\u00e4ter nicht ein kleines bi\u00dfchen nachgelassen hat. Was ne Hammer geile Zeit <3\n\nMitlerweile 38 Headliner aus 9 verschiedenen L\u00e4ndern <3\n\nDANKE DAF\u00dcR !\n\nAm 04.04 feiern wir Bday & Abschied zugleich. Ich hoffe ihr gebt euch trotz \"Time warp\" Wochenende ein letztes mal die Ehre und zeigt was diesen Event ausgemacht hat. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLINE UP\n\nBUNKERBOYS // Tumult & Kult / Reactor Beatz \n\nMARK MAYU // Tumult & Kult / Nature one\n\nTIMO MANDL // Tumult & Kult / Nacht:FUG  \n\nC.7EVEN // Tumult & Kult / Nachtwandler /Audiok\u00fcche \n\nGINGAT // Tumult & Kult / Sound of Techno \n\nTETE & RINARI // Tumult & Kult / Nachtwandler \n\nRICHIP // Tumult & Kult \n\nDURBAN TECHNO // Tumult & Kult \n\nS!RO // Tumult & Kult \n\nMARKUS BERGHOLD // Tumult & Kult / Construct Rhythm \n\nWABUN abschieds - Set // Eletrovision\n\n\n\nEINTRITT 10\u20ac (mit Timewarp Karte nur 5\u20ac)\nOPENING 23:00\nCLOSING 07:30 \n\n\nEINTRITT AB 18 JAHREN !!!",

He\u2019ll be flying over the sounds of Dirty Dutch for a very special showcase showcase at Fire-London this spring.\n\nCrossing the boundaries between various genres, Chuckie has put his distinctive stamp in clubs and is an innovator in building an eclectic sounding dance floor.  Refusing to be categorised to just one- his distinctive blend of house and hip hop has given him an edge that puts him on a pedestal above his piers. \n\nDirty Dutch has built up a reputation in all of the world\u2019s key electronic music hubs as a trendsetter that\u2019s revolutionised clubs worldwide. Continuously pushing the limits with its\u2019 music and events Chuckie has rustled up a selection of DJs that will get the Arches of Fire booming.\n\nNeeding no introduction Radio 1s Danny Howard will play alongside Audio Society and Skyhigh in support.

        "description": "Perhaps best known for The Pleasure Garden (1953), a film shot at Crystal Palace and awarded a prize by Jean Cocteau in Cannes, James Broughton was a man of many parts: a poet, a filmmaker, a socialite, a traveller, a husband, father, teacher and in the last third of his life, an out and radical gay man. He spent most of his creative life in San Francisco and from the late 1940s helped nurture an artistic culture that eventually gave birth to the Beats. \n\nBroughton's bisexual life changed forever when he began a love affair in 1975 with a young man 35 years his junior. Beautifully illustrated with extracts from his poetry and his many films, and liberally sprinkled with interviews from key collaborators, friends and family, Big Joy reveals James Broughton as a brilliantly perceptive visionary, a bold and inspiring interpreter of art and life and the joy of creation.\n\n\u2018Fascinating\u2026a revealing portrait of a man who helped to broaden our ideas of what films could accomplish.\u2019 -  The Hollywood Reporter\n\n\u2018A great documentary\u2019- Variety\n\nEnjoy THREE Big Joy: the Adventures of James Broughton  screenings at FLARE:\nThursday, March 27 ~ 6:10 PM\t\nSaturday, March 29 ~  1:00 PM\nSunday, March 30 ~  2:10 PM\n\nTickets go on sale 03-03-2014 11:30 AM here:\nhttp://bit.ly/1nWgemQ",

Nowadays he lives in Prague and he has found there an inspiration and soul mates. He has been loving music since ever and as he boy he went to music school where he played clarinet and guitar. As a teenager he was charmed by drum'n'bass and other electronic music. One of his big influences is Photek (Form And Function, Modus Operandi) or Krust (Coded Language). In his own production he uses contrast of curtness and strongly emotional atmosphere. Lately he has been influenced by contemporary sound that connects fragments of techno, garage, or deep house and he's preparing his album.

He appreciates an audience that is empathetic and makes him to be eclectic. His sets are not only random tracks but he selects them very carefully and creates a story out of them.

        "description": "ONLY UK SHOW -  the show will be hosted by Steve Tefis (IBP) & Seven Churches, with us helping promote the show. support from GRAVE MIASMA and CATTLE DECAPITATION\n\nFew bands have done more to push the boundaries of extreme metal than the legendary Possessed. Even fewer can create a unique style which continues to set them apart from all others in a genre they laid the foundation for. \n\nMike Torrao (guitar), Mike Sus (drums) and Barry Fisk (vocals) got their start playing covers of bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden. After Fisk\u2019s unfortunate suicide, Torrao and Sus recruited singer/bassist Jeff Becerra from local metal band Blizzard to form a new band - Possessed - whose name would eventually be known by heavy music fanatics worldwide. \n\nPossessed took San Francisco\u2019s metal scene by storm, playing with fellow Bay Area thrashers and friends Exodus, and other bands- many now long gone. In 1982-1983, they recorded a four song demo. One of the demo tracks, \u201cSwing of the Axe\u201d ended up on the Metal Massacre 6 compilation and later on \u201cThe Best of Metal Massacre.\u201d \n\nWhile starting to make waves in the metal community, Possessed replaced guitarist Brian Montana, whose dedication to the band had waned. To fill the void left by Montana, Jeff Becerra recruited friend and Blizzard band mate Larry LaLonde. LaLonde\u2019s passion for guitar and home-grown style fit Possessed perfectly; roughly six months after LaLonde joined Possessed, they signed to Combat Records. \n\nReleased in October 1985 on Combat Records, Seven Churches set a new standard for extreme music. Combining Torraro and LaLonde\u2019s lighting fast riffs, Becerra\u2019s raspy trademark growl and speedy bass playing, Sus\u2019s pummeling drums and Randy Burns\u2019 production, Seven Churches created a whole new genre of music- death metal. Written by primarily by Torrao and Becerra, Seven Churches went on to be one of Combat Records\u2019 best-selling albums. Not bad for a quartet of high school kids! \n\nTorrao and Becerra teamed up with LaLonde to write Beyond the Gates. Released on Halloween in 1986, this album was especially well-received in Europe where they toured at the end of the year. The album that changed the landscape of heavy metal, Seven Churches is the bar by which death metal albums are still measured. \n\nAfter that tour, Possessed recorded and released Eyes of Horror, a five song EP produced by Joe Satriani. Musically and lyrically advanced, the album touched on dark themes such as sin, drugs and violence. Not long after the release of the EP, LaLonde joined up with Les Claypool and Primus. Soon after, Sus left to continue his studies at SFSU and Torrao decided he no longer wanted to play in a band. Becerra continued to play and joined some side projects, but mostly took time to pursue his goals in life. At one point, Torrao attempted to re-create Possessed, but this attempt was short lived. \n\nIn 2004, Becerra joined with Sadistic Intent to record \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d for a Possessed tribute album. Becerra and Sadistic Intent decided to do a few live shows to satisfy fans who had been clamoring for shows for decades. With such a positive response, Becerra and Sadistic Intent continued to play a number of successful shows, including Wacken 2007, Maryland Deathfest 2009, and 2010\u2019s Blackest of the Black Tour. This lineup breathed life into Sadistic Intent and Becerra, and the two parties split amicably to play their own styles of metal, with drummer Emilio Marquez staying with Becerra and Possessed. \n\nIn 2011, Becerra and Marquez (Asesino, Coffin Texts, ex-Brujeria) found new blood in bassist Robert Cardenas (Masters Of Metal (formally know as Agent Steel), Malice, Coffin Texts, Engrave), along with guitarists Kelly McLauchlin (Pessimist, Diabolic, Unholy Ghost) and Daniel Gonzalez (Nailshitter). \n\nAfter making several live appearances, including Graspop 2012 & The Fallen Angel 2012 European Tour, this lineup has established Possessed for a new era. The Possessed legacy has been highly influential in the realm of extreme metal, changing the genre forever. Ready to take it further, Possessed is planning several tour dates and writing new material that will change the face of death metal once more.\n\nTickets \u00a320 Adv.\nhttp://www.seetickets.com/event/possessed/the-garage/758993\nhttps://www.stargreen.com/a-z/possessed.html\nhttp://www.ticketweb.co.uk/event/possessed-tickets/99319",

UK garage descends primarily from US Garage House, but also takes influence from Deep House, Jungle, and Oldschool RnB, among other genres. The trademark sound of Garage is its distinctive syncopated 4/4 percussive rhythm with 'shuffling' hi-hats and beat-skipping kick drums. Garage also often uses 'chopped up' and pitch-shifted vocals.\n   Its originator is widely recognised to be Todd Edwards, the American house and garage producer, also known as Todd \"The God\" Edwards. In the early nineties he began to start remixing more soulful house records and incorporating more time-shifts and vocal samples than normal house records, whilst still living in the US. It was Edwards who began to apply these techniques on his own Garage House productions. Garage House being a heavily disco influenced sub-genre of House Music that took its name from the New York City nightclub Paradise Garage where it was created in the mid 1980s. However it was not until DJ EZ, the North London DJ, acquired one of Todd's tracks and played it at a faster tempo in a night club in Greenwich, that the music genre really took off.\n\n     In the late 90s, Garage was growing strong in the underground scene: particularly in clubs and on pirate radio and in urban, inner city (primarily black) communities. Around the turn of the millennium, Garage became increasingly popular and new sub-genres such as 4x4, 2-Step, Speed Garage, and Dark Garage (precursor to Dubstep) were being developed. When it began to penetrate the mainstream with the help of artists like M.J. Cole, Artful Dodger, Jaimeson, So Solid Crew, Zed Bias,The Streets, Shanks &amp; Bigfoot, DJ Luck and MC Neat, Ed Case, Sunship, Oxide and Neutrino, and El-B, elements of soul, hip-hop, reggae, jazz, drum and bass, contemporary R& B, and pop music were also incorporated into Garage.\n\n     UK garage led to various offshoots in from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, most notably dubstep, bassline and grime. UK garage left the mainstream in the mid-2000s and returned underground. This was partially caused by the Top 40 being bombarded with derivative, copycat Garage-esque pop songs by producers trying to cash in on the trend (think of how producers are trying to incorporate \"Dubstep\" into various pop songs nowadays and multiply that by 100x more). Secondly, the rapid increase in popularity for the genre meant bigger crowds at gigs and in clubs. And statistically, bigger crowds meant bigger chance of unsavory characters around. And given that a lot of the fans of Garage were predominately minorities from high crime, lower class neighborhoods, violence became increasingly rampant at the these garage events. Shootings, stabbings, fights, and general rowdy behavior, while not commonplace, were always heavily covered by the media when they occurred. Even the mega stars of the genre fell victim to it: Dizzee Rascal was stabbed after a gig promoting his Mercury Prize winning debut \"Boy In Da Corner\" and a few members of Number 1 hit scoring So Solid Crew are still serving time for their involvement in a gang related drive by shooting. All this negative attention to the UK Garage scene led to \"Garage\" becoming a dirty word associated with bland pop tunes and gang violence. As Garage retreated back to its underground beginnings of pirate radio, small clubs, limited vinyl pressing, and bedroom producers, many artists jumped ship onto the emerging Garage offshoots like Dubstep and Grime that were growing in popularity everyday.\n\n   However in recent years, artists like Burial have brought Garage to new audiences and there has been a gradual resurgence in interest in the genre thanks in part to more widespread use of the internet and the popularity of Garage offshoot Dubstep. In the latter half of the decade there was a brief revival of 2-Step Garage in UK clubs with Oldschool producers returning to the scene with new tracks as well as tracks by various new-school producers. Around this time a new genre dubbed \"Future Garage\" emerged, although it was very tenuously linked to UK Garage despite its name. However, its popularity gave more prominence to Oldschool Garage. In the 2010s, interest in Garage has increased even more as the heavily- commercialized and aggressive \"Brostep\" has worn it's welcome on many: leading some fans and to go back to the heavily garage influenced stylings of old-school Dubstep while \"Brostep\" is currently falling out of fashion in the mainstream and in clubs.\n\n\n     This departure has left a huge hole which is looking more and more like it will be filled with the resurgence of Garage. Garage hits by fresh-faced producers like Disclosure, Mosca, Naughty Boy, Jessie Ware as well as vocals done by popular singers like Sam Smith, AlunaGeorge, Eliza Doolittle, and Emile Sande on these tracks, the continued success of Garage enthusiasts Jamie XX, Burial and Four Tet, increased attention for the genre on the internet and outlets like Radio 1, the constant year to year touring of Garage innovator DJ EZ, as well as the return of older producers who made the genre what it is today like Zed Bias, Wookie, El-B, and Artful (one half of Artful Dodger) are helping bring the genre back big time and are paving the way for the next generation of Garage producers.\n    \n     As \"Sincere\" hitmaker MJ Cole once said, \"London is a multicultural city... it's like a melting pot of young people, and that's reflected in the music of UK garage\".",

It is also a showcase for less well known and smaller firms.\n\nThe speakers will provide valuable insights into the methods and approaches that have made them successful, comment on the current investment climate and offer specific investment ideas. A key feature of the conference is the 10-15 minutes dedicated to audience Q&A for each speaker, led by David Shapiro.\n\nValue Investing\n\nValue Investing was developed in the early Twentieth Century by Benjamin Graham and has been popularised in recent decades by the success of many investors who follow the approach, most notably Warren Buffett. It is now a well respected investment style in the US but is still a nascent sector of the investment universe elsewhere.\n\nNumerous academic studies have shown that a disciplined value-based approach to investing in securities outperforms the market over the long term. It is under-pinned by research into behavioural investing which demonstrates both why it is so psychologically difficult to do (because it involves taking positions that are contrary to the received wisdom of the crowd) and why it is so financially rewarding when done well.\n\nWhat you can expect:\n\n- Insight into successful techniques and approaches used by top value investors\n- Investment ideas presented in detail\n- Research on the long-term success of value investing\n- Networking with like-minded investors\n\nFor more details with information about offered conference participation packages, please contact us by email: bank-of-investmentprojects@mail.com",

From August 1983 up to 1987, taking the audience from \u201cConfusion\u201d to \u201cTrue Faith\u201d, with both \u201cLow Life\u201d and \u201cBrotherhood\u201d performed in full alongside all the other tracks from that fans consider New Order\u2019s greatest period including \u201cThieves Like Us\u201d \u201cBizarre Love Triangle\u201d, \u201cThe Perfect Kiss\u201d and many more.\n\nHaving released \u201cBlue Monday\u201d and \u201cTemptation\u201d, the band had grown in confidence and attained increasing success in the UK and internationally. Praised for their creativity,  boundary pushing and consistent touring, the albums saw the group finding their niche and signature sound. Fusing their rock, indie style with new emerging electronic equipment and bringing melody and emotion to their techno experiments. Both the singles and the albums for this period stand out as some of the finest work ever produced by the band.\n\nMarking the high period of New Order artistically, the critical plaudits heaped upon \u201cPower, Corruption & Lies\u201d was followed by similar notices for \u201cLow Life\u201d and \u201cBrotherhood\u201d, considered as a trio, the band\u2019s greatest albums which were achieved through a period of intense hard work which brought significant results and advancements. Having raised their profile with \u201cBlue Monday\u201d, still the biggest ever selling 12\u201d in history, the band continued to define their status with their diffident attitude to promotion, Peter Saville\u2019s iconic design and their disregard of mid Eighties video culture and the MTV generation.\n\nWith FAC 51 The Hacienda Club open in Manchester, the band decamped to New York in 1983 to work with Arthur Baker, who co-wrote and produced the first two singles from the period \u201cConfusion\" and \"Thieves Like Us\".\n\nArthur famously dance floor tested \"Confusion\" prior to release in \u2018The Fun House\u2019, one of New York's most famous underground clubs where the video was later filmed. The subsequent single became many fan\u2019s favourite record, the effortless, timeless shimmering beauty of \u201cThieves Like Us\u201d.\n\nReleasing \u201cLow Life\u201d in 1985 alongside epic single \u201cThe Perfect Kiss\u201d, whose 9 minute 12 inch mix, full of peaks and troughs is considered one of the best of the decade. The romantic club sounds of Low Life and its playful sense of humour has made many regard it as New Order\u2019s most complete single album. Aside from the singles, the album contains many great records that have entered the canon, including \u201cThis Time Of Night\u201d, \u201cSunrise\u201d, \u201cElegia\u201d, \u201cSooner Than You Think\u201d, and the album\u2019s closer \u201cFace Up\u201d, an energetic and euphoric club track.\n\nWith the band now signed to Quincy Jones\u2019 Qwest label in the States, they began to tour internationally to ever increasing capacities. Their transatlantic success underlined by the appearance of songs \u201cElegia\u201d \u201cThieves Like Us\u201d and \u201cShellshock\u201d on John Hughes \u201cPretty In Pink\u201d Film Soundtrack in 1986, as well as the uniquely stylised videos which accompanied the singles.\nCoupling the release of \u201cState Of The Nation\u201d to \u201cBrotherhood\u201d in September 1986, the first single was superseded by the band\u2019s biggest international hit since 1983, the anthemic musical landmark \u201cBizarre Love Triangle\u201d which broke the band fully through to North American, international and even Australian audiences.\n\n\u201cBrotherhood\u201d itself took a unique approach, splitting the rock side of the band to the first side of the album, with tracks \u201cParadise\u201d, \u201cAs It Is When It Was\u201d and \u201cWay Of Life\u201d, whereas the flips side was electronic, taking in the two singles and also \u201cEvery Second Counts\u201d, a finely tuned electronic ballad regarded as the counterpoint to \u201cPower, Corruption & Lies\u201d \u201cLeave Me Alone\u201d\nWith The Light\u2019s concerts running up to 1987, (when New Order\u2019s best-selling album \u201cSubstance\u201d, a compilation of all the singles and B-sides was released, reportedly so Tony Wilson could play them in his new in car CD) New Order enjoyed their biggest international hit \u201cTrue Faith\u201d. Some seven years after the demise of Joy Division and a decade on from first forming, the band had come full circle to hit heights never thought possible, showing that \u201cDreams Never End\u201d.  \n\nWith a set list so full of classic records and fans favourites, many never heard for some twenty five years or more, this music defined the times and still sounds current today.\nPeter Hook & The Light\u2019s \u201cLowlife\u201d & \u201cBrotherhood\u201d concerts chart New Order\u2019s final stage of evolution from the post punk of Joy Division to defining themselves as electro pop pioneers at the cutting edge of the emerging club scene in the mid to late Eighties.\n\nThe Light will also be supporting themselves at the concerts performing a selection of Joy Division material.\n\nAs with the previous debut album concerts by The Light, both gigs benefit two charities, Mind, the mental health charity and Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy.\n\nFor videos and concert footage from The Light check -www.youtube.com/peterhookandthelight \nwww.peterhook.co.uk / www.facebook.com/peterhookandthelight\n\nOn \u201cLow Life\u201d\n\n\"Realigned as New Order, they successfully adapted their trauma to the dance floor, where their deviant fusion of black-funk rhythm tricks and English avant-punk had resulted in stunning club hits like \"Temptation\" and \"Blue Monday.\" Low-Life, the group's third album, caps its long, methodical glide into pop's mainstream. \"Love Vigilantes\" and \"The Perfect Kiss\" both take full advantage of the remix lessons New Order learned under Arthur Baker, who produced its 1984 single \"Confusion.\" On Low-Life, New Order made the most of accessibility without compromising their past.\" Rolling Stone \n\nOn \u201cBrotherhood\u201d\n\n\"Brotherhood is the last of the \u2018old-guard\u2019 of New Order albums but not their last good album. It contains the most complete synthesis of the band\u2019s sound, which only really diverged after that point. The galloping, tinny riffage, the skittering hi-hats, the sunburst of keyboard swells, the melodies picked out on bass . . . They also cast off the last remaining traces of Joy Division here \u2013 Peter Hook says goodbye to his past on \u2018As It Is When It Was\u2019 with a cheeky little riff from \u2018Love Will Tear Us Apart\u2019.\" The Quietus\n\nOn Peter Hook And The Light Live \n\n\u201cNot only did Hooky and his band open the show with Joy Division songs, he proceeded to play New Order\u2019s two full albums and a stellar encore....Hooky and his band really put 110% into this show.\u201d LA Record\n\n \u201cSay what you will about Peter Hook, the man has got balls\u2026.It was most enjoyable to revisit these albums\u2026.for those in the audience who had been too young or not even born when these albums were released, this was clearly a welcome opportunity to get the flavour of these musical riches in concert.\u201d The Times\n\n\u201cTaking in the show, I could imagine that this is what it might have felt like hearing the original New Order playing that material back in the day.  More organic and authentic to the time. I really, really enjoyed this show immensely.\u201d Rock Subculture\n\n\"Now, 30 years later, the songs really come to life with a punchier musical delivery than they ever had on record, and an uber-confident Hook belting them out. The most fascinating thing about the gig is hearing the journey between Joy Division and the classic New Order sound over the course of two hours.\" Artrocker\n\n \u201cHooky is the Rock God of bass players. His performance at North London\u2019s Koko had far more energy than last summer\u2019s Hyde Park show by the rest of New Order. He closed with a triumphant Temptation and the inevitable encore of Blue Monday. You've still got it, Hooky.\u201d The Sun\n\n\u201cThe show was an unquestionable treat for fans....Hooky is an outstanding bass player and it's truly magical to see him live in action.....Don't miss this tour if it's coming to your city.  Peter Hook is a legend.\u201d Hang The DJ / x89 Radio\n\n\u201cBest decision I made all year? Quite possibly.... My god, man. Go see this band.... Well played, Mr. Hook. Well played.\u201d The Pale Drummer\n\n \u201cThere was never any doubt that this gig by the New Order legend and his new band was to be something quite extraordinary... Hooky\u2019s bouncing, bending stage presence give this whole performance the urgency and, aptly, movement that it might be said is lacking in the \u2018other\u2019 New Order\u2019s live performances of the past year.\u201d Manchester Evening News\n\n \u201cWhat Hooky has done is grab these songs by the scruff of the neck and give them a punkiness with his bass driving the songs with an added raw power. Tonight is a real triumph - everything was perfect from the venue, to the acoustics, to the delivery of the songs, to the tight band, to the vocals and that distinctive great bass playing...Hooky has made these songs have a very different narrative and put a whole new heart and soul into them.\u201d Louder Than War\n\nAbout Peter Hook And The Light \n\nPeter Hook And The Light features Peter Hook on vocals and bass, Jack Bates on bass, David Potts on guitar, Andy Poole on keyboards and Paul Kehoe on drums. Having first performed the Joy Division albums in 2010, the band have continued to perform all of the Joy Division catalogue and have recently completed tours of North and South America and the UK and Ireland performing \"Movement\" and \"Power Corruption And Lies\". Plans for 2014 include European and Far East dates including the band's first ever visit to China and festival appearances prior to the first \"Low Life\" and \"Brotherhood\" shows in September.",

Accantonati i monotoni impegni e le incombenze dell\u2019inizio, tutti si ritrovano e si perdono nella notte pi\u00f9 esclusiva della settimana. La Night Life romana \u00e8 finalmente competitiva nella scena off mondiale grazie a VEGA e al suo ANY GIVEN MONDAY. Un luned\u00ec per pochi. Scorretto, insolito, non convenzionale, caratterizzato dalle esuberanti sonorit\u00e0 vintage dell\u2019indie-rock e dalle afose rotondit\u00e0 dell\u2019electro. Qualcuno dica a Bob Geldof che ormai \u201cI don\u2019t like mondays\u201d \u00e8 un\u2019affermazione superata.\n\nL\u2019ANY GIVEN MONDAY si discosta, sia esteticamente che concettualmente, dai canoni usuali del divertimento notturno. \u00c8 un format-party \u201cglocale\u201d che importa elementi esterofili all\u2019avanguardia, personalizzandoli notevolmente, e riadattandoli alla realt\u00e0 off capitolina.\n\n\u00c8 una festa MADE AT HOME, spiazzante per la sua diversit\u00e0, dove l\u2019imperativo non \u00e8 apparire, ma divertirsi. \u00c8 un happening, un carnevale perenne, \u00e8 musica, teatro, danza, arte, moda, video, televisione, avanspettacolo e molto, ma molto di pi\u00f9, del prodotto che si ottiene moltiplicando tutti questi fattori tra di loro. \u00c8 un posto incantato, fuori dal tempo e dallo spazio, veramente FREE e OPEN. \u00c8 un contenitore difficile da descrivere dove c\u2019\u00e8 tutto e il contrario di tutto, sempre uguale ma in continuo mutamento.\n\nL\u2019ANY GIVEN MONDAY \u00e8 un party dall\u2019animo sensibile, il vestito vintage, l\u2019aspetto kitsch e il cuore naif, con uno sguardo avanguardistico e una straordinaria capacit\u00e0 di prendersi in giro e prendere in giro una citt\u00e0 tanto seria come Roma. \u00c8 controcorrente e retr\u00f2, ma sempre contemporaneo e attuale, pieno di vizi e stravaganze.\n\n\u00c8 stato indubbiamente la pluripremiata novit\u00e0 degli ultimi anni, definito da molti addetti ai lavori un \u201casso piglia tutto che non pu\u00f2 non piacere\u201d, aristocratico e popolare, raffinato e cafone, fa delle sue contraddizioni e delle sue divergenze il suo pi\u00f9 grande pregio.

So here I am raising money and awareness for two charities very close to my heart:\n\nMIND:  They provide advice and support to empower anyone experiencing a mental health problem. They campaign to improve services, raise awareness and promote understanding.\n\nALZHEIMER'S SOCIETY:  Leading the fight against dementia. They work hard to improve the quality of life of people affected by dementia as well as providing much needed support and guidance to families.\n\nMy beautiful nan passed away from Alzheimer's.  She was an amazing, loving person with the biggest heart in the world!  I am running this year in honor of her memory and in the process hoping to raise awareness of dementia and mental illness so that we can spot the signs earlier and seek help - Forgetting where you put your dentures may not just be a sign of old age!  \n\nI really appreciate all your support and thank you for any donations.  Please gift aid on a charity's behalf where eligible for this.\n\nSee you at the finishing line!\n\nMuch love Manjinder! xxxxx\n\nMany Thanks\n\nXclusive PR",

La Night Life romana \u00e8 finalmente competitiva nella scena off mondiale grazie a VEGA e al suo ANY GIVEN MONDAY. Un luned\u00ec per pochi. Scorretto, insolito, non convenzionale, caratterizzato dalle esuberanti sonorit\u00e0 vintage dell\u2019indie-rock e dalle afose rotondit\u00e0 dell\u2019electro. Qualcuno dica a Bob Geldof che ormai \u201cI don\u2019t like mondays\u201d \u00e8 un\u2019affermazione superata.\n\nL\u2019ANY GIVEN MONDAY si discosta, sia esteticamente che concettualmente, dai canoni usuali del divertimento notturno. \u00c8 un format-party \u201cglocale\u201d che importa elementi esterofili all\u2019avanguardia, personalizzandoli notevolmente, e riadattandoli alla realt\u00e0 off capitolina.\n\n\u00c8 una festa MADE AT HOME, spiazzante per la sua diversit\u00e0, dove l\u2019imperativo non \u00e8 apparire, ma divertirsi. \u00c8 un happening, un carnevale perenne, \u00e8 musica, teatro, danza, arte, moda, video, televisione, avanspettacolo e molto, ma molto di pi\u00f9, del prodotto che si ottiene moltiplicando tutti questi fattori tra di loro. \u00c8 un posto incantato, fuori dal tempo e dallo spazio, veramente FREE e OPEN. \u00c8 un contenitore difficile da descrivere dove c\u2019\u00e8 tutto e il contrario di tutto, sempre uguale ma in continuo mutamento.\n\nL\u2019ANY GIVEN MONDAY \u00e8 un party dall\u2019animo sensibile, il vestito vintage, l\u2019aspetto kitsch e il cuore naif, con uno sguardo avanguardistico e una straordinaria capacit\u00e0 di prendersi in giro e prendere in giro una citt\u00e0 tanto seria come Roma. \u00c8 controcorrente e retr\u00f2, ma sempre contemporaneo e attuale, pieno di vizi e stravaganze.\n\n\u00c8 stato indubbiamente la pluripremiata novit\u00e0 degli ultimi anni, definito da molti addetti ai lavori un \u201casso piglia tutto che non pu\u00f2 non piacere\u201d, aristocratico e popolare, raffinato e cafone, fa delle sue contraddizioni e delle sue divergenze il suo pi\u00f9 grande pregio. All\u2019AGM ci sono tutti! Gente di ogni tipo: persone diversissime tra di loro e di tutte le parti del mondo che magicamente ballano, saltano e si divertono insieme.\n\nIl suo essere off e casalingo \u00e8 diventato in breve tempo di massa, la sua irruzione nel panorama della night life romana \u00e8 stata come quella di un uragano, che ha cambiato le regole del gioco, spazzando via consuetudini decennali e modificando il concetto stesso di divertimento. Per questi e mille altri motivi l\u2019ANY GIVEN MONDAY \u00e8 gi\u00e0 mito, ma nonostante tutto rimane quello che \u00e8 sempre stato: un party controcorrente e all\u2019occasione contro anche se stesso, una festicciola tra amici nel salone di casa dove ognuno porta qualche cosa e ci si ritrova a conoscersi tutti.\n\nL\u2019AGM oggi piu' che mai rimane MADE AT HOME, OFF, CHEAP e OPEN rappresentando in festa l\u2019essenza stessa del luned\u00ec. L\u2019AGM \u00e8 un posto magico: la casa di tutti e il party di tutti nato sotto la buona stella di VEGA, custodito dai dentoni del giaguaro e abitato da sempre nuovi e strabilianti personaggi in cerca d\u2019autore.\n\nPROGRAMMA\n\nSTAGE JOHNNY (2nd FLOOR)\n\nH22.30 START\nH23.01 DISCOUNT\nH00.01 STACEY MALIBU'\nH01.01 EDO PIETROGRANDE (D:VISION)\nH02.01 MOKAI\nH04.31 STOP\n_______________________________________________________\n\nSTAGE JAGUAR (1st FLOOR)\n\n22.30 START\n23.30 KIN 8\n00.45 STEFANO GAMMA\n03.01 ROMEO RODEO\n_________________________________________________________\n\nSTAGE SKULL (1st FLOOR)\n23.30 START\n00.00 RENE V.\n01.15 LECANER\n02.30 ESOX\n04.00 STOP\n__________________________________________________________\n\nSTAGE ROXANNE (GROUND FLOOR)\n\n22.30 START\n23.30 BARBY DJ\n00.45 BAL DORIA (WOOOW!)\n02.15 JOE DOMINGUEZ & LONDON PRIDE\n04.00 STOP\n___________________________________________________________\n\nEDO PIETROGRANDE\nI'm Edo Pietrogrande, audio engineer and architect.\nOwner of till2012 records and loud & proud mastering studio, my career as dj started in 1998 when i was 15.\nI've played in best venues around italy and Europe, Room 26, brancaleone, Goa club, magazzini Generali...\nNow I'm working as producer for television and mastering engineer in my studio.\nI'm also working for a booking agency and as always djing around Italy and sometimes Europe.\nNever stop...

Want to know more about London Calling, read below some statements accredited to us:\n\nTalk of the town since launching over summer are Pure\u2019s \u201cLondon Calling\u201d Friday nights.\nIf the concept sounds simple, the execution isn\u2019t. This is a well-considered operation, with the entertainment brought to you by the organizers of \u017burawina\u2019s cult \u201cLive Monday\u2019s.\u201d Yes, expect live music, and yes, expect jaunty themes to add an extra sprinkling of fizz!\n\nGuests are ushered into a luxurious environment that\u2019s upmarket but never overwhelming \u2013 it\u2019s not splashy, gold-plated oligarch, more discreet and elegant. It\u2019s definitely more London than new money Moscow.\n\nThe audience is diverse, more democratic. All nationalities gather, with the age ranges spanning the late 20s to the 50s. In short, no-one feels left out.\n\nBy 11 p.m. the place was jumping with a veritable roll-call of familiar faces old and new: anticipate lots of boozy back slaps as you reacquaint yourself with people you haven\u2019t seen for many a month (years, even). And that, to me, is their greatest success \u2013 London Calling might still be in its infancy, but it\u2019s already created something rare\u2026 a sense of community. It\u2019s as much about the people as it is about the music\u201d\n[Review: Warsaw Insider October 2013]\n\nLondon Calling \u2013 \u201cThe People Make The Party\u201d\nWe welcome advanced bookings, table bookings for dining, events, birthday parties \u2013 you name the occasion, we will accommodate you, London Calling \u2013 Pure Sky Club.\n\nLive music from 21:00\nPlease book a table in advance: info@pureskyclub.com",

        "description": "Once voted \"the most beautiful man in the world\", Swedish singer/songwriter Jay-Jay Johanson, born in Trollh\u00e4ttan, October 11, 1969, started composing already as a teenager, but it wasn't until August 1996 he was to release his first album, \"Whiskey\". Recorded at Break My Heart Studios, in the Stockholm archipelago. The instant success of this debut album, caractarized by its jazzy vocals over trippy, film noir arrangements, took Jay-Jay out on his first of many world tours. After \"Whiskey\" with its unforgettable songs like \"It Hurts Me So\" and \"So Tell The Girls That I Am Back In Town\", Johanson released \"Tattoo\" in 1998.\n\nThe first step in his music's evolution into a more richly textured, poetic ambience, as we can hear in the haunting \"Milan Madrid Chicago Paris\", \"Even In The Darkest Hour\" and \"She's Mine But I'm Not Hers\". Released in April 2000, \"Poison\" went straight into the French chart at number four. Darker more depressive themes were presented, and frustration was sometimes heard in Jay-Jay's voice. The album featured contributions from The Cocteau Twins founder and guitarist Robin Guthrie. The same year Johanson also composed the soundtrack to the film \"La Confusion Des Genres\", made by French director Ilan Cohen, and in 2001, Jay-Jay Johanson emerged with \"Cosmodrome\", a sound-and-image installation first exhibited in Dijon. This art-piece has travelled around the world and was last shown at Mus\u00e9e d'Art Modern in Paris. The delicate electronic ingredients heard in \"Cosmodrome\" became a link into Jay-Jay's next album \"Antenna\" released 2002, an ambitious side project, recorded with assistance from german electronica experimentalists Funkst\u00f6rung.\n\nYear 2004 marked the release of a compilation, \"Prologue\", meant for the American market, which made for an excellent introduction to most of Johanson's material. The next step in Jay-Jay's career was the album \"Rush\" from 2005, an album partly produced by the French House genius J-P Ensuque. The next 12 months proved to be a prolific period in terms of songwriting, and Jay-Jay Johanson soon found himself with a new collection of material. And in the spring of 2006 Jay-Jay Johanson decided to call together the former musicians he had worked with on the three first albums.\n\nJanuary 2007 saw the release of \"The Long Term Physical Effects Are Not Yet Known\". Maybe even more seductive and startlingly eclectic than any of his prior work. The album was generally acclaimed as his finest ever, and it spawned great singles in the languorous ballad, \"She Doesn't Live Here Anymore\" and the mesmerizing \"Rocks In Pockets\". A \"Long Term\" tour started off in China and continued to more that 30 cities around the world, with Jay-Jay fronting his quartet. Work on his new album began after this tour and took just over four months to complete. Writing and recording were carried out in bursts, between which he simply got on with his new life as a father. The tapes started rolling in Jay-Jay's home studio in Sundbyberg early spring 2007. The poetic strength of Johanson's lyrics and vocals was matched on these recordings by innovative arrangements together with an element of continuity provided by drummer Magnus Frykberg and piano player Erik Jansson.\n\n\"Wonder Wonders\" is a searching and evocative song where spare rhythms, avant-garde guitar playing and fleeting piano chords lay under Johanson's smouldering tenor. \"Lightning Strikes\", another epic ballad from Jay-Jay with austere orchestrations and romantic lyrics. \u201cMy Mother's Grave\u201d revolves around Erik\u2019s steady piano playing and Frykberg\u2019s lightly swinging monotone rhythm, but it broadens the textural landscape with assorted elements of noise. Jay-Jay\u2019s ability to bring together textures that would seem to have nothing in common make his songs so consistently interesting. Even when he resorts to relative conventional changes, as on the closing track \u201cSore\u201d where the arrangements are so imaginative, and the rhythmic displacements so intriguing, that they never sound commonplace.With his seventh album \"Self-Portrait\" Jay-Jay Johanson remains as surprising and daring as ever, exchanging the ornate arrangements and etheral strings of earlier releases for organic noise and twisted sensibilities.\n\nJohanson\u2019s melancholic songwriting and orchestral vision are what ultimately makes this new album such a compelling record, intriguing textures and sonic combinations aside, it\u2019s as good a collection of songs as Jay-Jay Johanson has written to date, and even at it's most accessible it's filled with structural surprises that make for listening that avoids the predictable. \"Self-Portrait\", recorded in the Break My Heart studio, with contributions from the American improvisation guitarist Jeff Rian, is both alluring and urbane, The albums's trip-hop textures belie its troubled lyrics, inspired by personal concerns. All songs married subtly catchy melodies to intricate atmospheres. Tension underlies the crisp rhythms and experimental playing, while the distinctive vocals draw out the sentiment in his songwriting.\n\nAs he prepares to bring this new work to a new world tour, Jay-Jay Johanson continues to confront the personal challenges that have enriched his work for more than a decade. And he continues to follow this path \u2013 with patience, perseverance, and beauty.",

Over the almost 20 years that Spikey Tee has been working in the music industry he has progressed from being a warehouse DJ in London, to band member of avant-garde group The Sindecut, to lead vocalist in Jah Wobble\u2019s Invaders Of The Heart. All the while Spikey has continued to DJ, mixing hip-hop, R&B, ragga, and drum \u2018n\u2019 bass.\n\nA sharp MC, Spikey\u2019s list of collaborations reads like a who\u2019s who of the world\u2019s dub stars including Mr Scruff, Morcheeba, Massive Attack and Bomb the Bass, as well as reggae legends such as Dennis Alcapone, Ranking Joe and Horace Andy to name but a notable few.\n\nHis DJ-ing, MC-ing and singing skills have taken him around the world to Australia, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Germany, Norway, Russia, Finland and Vietnam among a host of others. Much loved by the CAMA collective, Spikey blew the roof off of ATK in 2012 and 2013, so getting him this April was an easy decision.\n\nExpect Spikey Tee to be dropping wicked Jamaican inspired soul-style vocals over his trademark mix of hip-hop, R&B, ragga and drum \u2018n\u2019 bass.\n\nTickets: 100k advance (ticketbox.vn or at CAMA ATK + get a free beer!)",

        "description": "As part of its public programme, the Nouveau Musee National of Monaco \u2013Villa Paloma presents Disrupt!on, a performance installation by Julien Bayle, curated by Fran\u00e7ois Larini (NMNM), which takes place simultaneously and live in Monaco and at news of the world space in London \n(LIVE: Friday 28th March: 7pm in London -8pm Monaco local time).\n\nJulien Bayle is a minimalist sound and visual artist working at the juncture of sound, visual and digital data.\nREAD MORE:\nhttp://julienbayle.net/disruption\n\nThrough successive digitally generated and evolving sequences, Disrupt!on explores the phenomenon of disturbance. It reflects how a deterministic system can produce - through its existence within a wider system and through external interventions - an effect which becomes unpredictable.\n\nThe Disrupt!on performance at Villa Paloma is an electronic piece lasting about 30 minutes exploring and developing all the work\u2019s concepts, producing its sounds and displaying the continuous flow of data. The performer interacts with sound, sometimes changing the low-level parameters of the oscillators, sometimes altering time parameters without ever using a proper tempo, but every time destabilising the very system he created.\n\nThe Disrupt!on installation at news of the world space is London is triggered by the start of the live sound/visual performance in Monaco which activates some of the installation\u2019s processes through the internet, using basic communication protocols. The data fed into the algorithms by the artist creates an aural and visual output which, from Monaco, evolves, informed, corrupted and ruptured by audience interaction through social networks as the data travels the net to London. The higher the number of interaction, the greater the unpredictability of the system\u2019s output.\n\nAfter the end of the performance in Monaco, the London installation is fully launched, and the stimuli received from the present audience or tele-participant, through Twitter #blpmc, continue to disrupt the installation, creating glitches, reaction, random events and system degeneration. Each hashtag are sensed and contribute to increase the global installation\u2019s entropy.\n\nExperimenting with the concept of control vs. chaos both in his installations and live performances, Julien Bayle draws from Richard Artschwager's \"blp\" idea, seen as a kind of sudden burst of information within various landscapes.\n\nIn our era of digital sound and cloud computing, the name itself (blp pronounced \u201cblip\u201d) refers to an electronic sound suddenly appearing in our soundscape as a noise, an alarm or a tune\u2026 (like Artschwager blp suddenly appears in a landscape). Within a computer and network based audio-visual system, they can be translated into a behavior that would be new, uncanny and disruptive.\n\nThe originals blps - an oblong shape developed by Richard Artschwager in 1967-1968 - were flat painted pieces of wood, but he soon made them from spray paints and stencils, adhesive decals and rubberized hair. In 1971, the exhibition Sonsbeek buiten de perken (Sonsbeek Between Lawn and Order) took place in the Netherlands. Artschwager\u2019s contribution, Utrecht Projekt, consisted of blps installed around the city and a catalogue of photo-documentation showing the blps in urban and rural settings. The catalogue was accompanied by an album that played the sound of a ticking clock on one side and that of a dripping tap on the other. He considered these mundane noises an auditory counterpart to his blps: background sounds that often go unheeded, but which, once noticed, are almost impossible to ignore.\n\nThis installation has been supported by and prepared at Gmem CNCM marseille / Thanks a lot to Christian, Sarah & J\u00e9r\u00f4me there !the",
