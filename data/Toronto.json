Queen's Park protest & Pig & Cow Save vigils:\n\n\u2022 Wednesday, April 9, 2014: Queens' Park Protest, 12 - 1pm, Stop government subsidies to pig factory farming and Quality Meat Packers and Great Lakes Meats slaughterhouses. Last week, Quality Meat Packers sought creditor protection under the federal Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act; this often leads to bankruptcy. Toronto Pig Save demands that no provincial and federal government subsidies be given to Quality Meat Packers in Toronto; Great Lakes Meats, which is QMP's Mitchell plant; Conestoga Meat Packers, and other killing facilities. Instead, the government ought to subsidize organic plants and vegetables and support healthy living, public health, a green economy, and animal protection, which would benefit all.\n\n\u2022 Thursday, April 10: Toronto Cow Save, 8 - 10 am at \"St. Helen's\" and \"Ryding-Regency Meat Packers\" slaughterhouses.\n\n\u2022 Friday, April 11: Waterloo Wellington Animal Save vigil at Conestoga in Breslau. Details here: https://www.facebook.com/events/282530261910300/\nCarpooling from Toronto: please contact Susan Banks\n\n\u2022 Sunday, April 13, 11am - 1pm, Toronto Pig Save vigil at Lake Shore & Strachan. The vigil will be followed by a memorial at QMP for all the millions of ghosts--the innocent pig victims killed there. QMP announced last week that it is in receivership and may transfer to Mitchell (west of Stratford) where it owns \"Great Lakes Meats\" slaughterhouse. We will be mounting 100s of photos as a memorial to the pig angel victims. Each pig is an individual with a personality as wonderful as Esther the Wonder Pig. We mourn the millions of lives cut short in a cruel and unspeakable manner at \"Quality Meat Packers\" slaughterhouse. \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFollow TorontoPigSave on Twitter, Instagram & Tumblr.

The Heels on Wheels Glitter Roadshow tours the US annually with a dazzling, diverse cabaret of performance art works and acts of resistance by queer folks of femme-inine spectrum genders. The fearless artists rampage from hi-femme to femmedrogyny in a wild revue of visceral poetic performance, emotional escape plans, high femme drag, multimedia mermaids, and rocknroll you can sink your heels into!\n\nThe show itself consists of six touring performers and local acts in every city \u2013 including Toronto locals Sedina Fiati, Sunny Drake, and Alex Cafarelli!\n\nShomi Noise plays guitar and reads from her zine series \u201cBuilding Up Emotional Muscles,\u201d the story of her journey as a Bolivian immigrant navigating U.S. culture and finding herself through alternative music scenes. Damien Luxe \u201cFemme Footprints In The Sand\u201d uses mermaids and powdered milk to explore thriving past poverty. Heather \u00c1cs\u2019 \u201cWelcome to the Waldorf Hysteria\u201d uses multi-media high-femme drag histrionics to reach beyond language and ask, what do we gain when we lose control? Angel Nafis\u2019 poetry celebrates the everything and everywhere of her world, of love and divinity, of her black girl brilliance in its vastness and depth. Alvis Parsley's heartfelt confession draws on their experiences as a genderqueer Asian while questioning the roles of institutions, authority, and the ecosystem of the arts with both humor and tenderness.\nSabina Ibarrola melts down and melts hearts in a pop culture performative exploration of breaking up and breaking through with the help of karaoke and Carrie Bradshaw. This year also includes a selection of video art by Louis Chavez, Kristin Li, Ellie Beth, Jacqueline Mary, and Celeste Chan.\n\nCome see the glitter and grit for yourself: don\u2019t miss the fifth Heels on Wheels Glitter Roadshow, April 11-20, 2014, heelsonwheelsroadshow.com \n\nAccess info: The venue is 19+ (not all-ages). Wheelchair accessible to enter. Washrooms are on the ground floor with no steps but no extra-wide stalls. Unfortunately, there will be no ASL interpretation this time.\n\nXO,\nHeels on Wheels\n\nHeels on Wheels is a Brooklyn-based group of interdisciplinary artists who create performance-based cultural works and community events that have a feminist and radical agenda, are produced from sites of femme/inine-positive queer embodiment, and reveal the power in under-represented communities.

Starting this January Excision will hit the road only weeks after wrapping the final string of Destroid live shows for 2013. \n\nEmbracing an unyielding pursuit to push the boundaries of bass music, Excision is continually creating and re-imagining innovative uses of cutting edge technology to impact his fans, as well as the EDM community at large. This 2014 Tour will prove to be his most extensive and most immersive tour experience to date. With an already phenomenal level of production at his disposal, you better believe he has gone even further. He is stepping things up to a whole new level and bringing a monstrous 150,000 watts of sound, which is capable of delivering insanely loud yet crystal clear audio to blast dance floors with room shaking bass in a way that bass music is ultimately designed to be felt as well as heard.\n\nThe 2014 tour also marks the return of the 28 foot wide, 15 foot tall mammoth video and lighting installation known as The Executioner. This custom crafted stage production was specifically designed for Excisions 3D video mapped visual sequences as he DJ's both music and video live on stage. The Executioner is fully recharged and returning as Excision\u2019s on-stage bass bunker, complete with brand new 3D visual animations displayed across its 420 square feet of surface area. This technological audio video monstrosity is equipped with various sliding panels and pneumatics to hide lazers, fog machines, an extensively upgraded lighting system and more than a few surprises yet to be revealed.\n\n\nDirtyphonics\n-\nDirtyphonics, the fabulous french DJ team joins with Excision for his 2014 tour. Bringing their signature style of genre bending madness from DNB, Electro House and everything in between, don't miss a second of their electrifying sets as they set the world on fire!",

This lesson is not merely inaccurate \u2013 it has created a way of being that is disconnected, anxious and off-balance. Our primary challenge is to recover the harmony of our being. Philip has gained an international reputation as a teacher whose original techniques enable people to reunite their conscious thinking with the deep-dwelling intelligence of the body, and to do so in a way that grounds us in the present, and gently opens a door to the experience of wholeness.  In the process, he provides tools to last a lifetime.\n\nThe workshop takes place in a remarkably supportive natural environment: poised at the edge of Lake Ontario, in the middle of an island park that is just a ten-minute ferry ride from the bustle of downtown Toronto.

        "description": "Presentation 1: \"The Universe in a Computer\"\n\nFrom smartphones and tablets to FuelBands and Google Glass, computers have revolutionized our everyday life. But did you know that computers also allow us to learn about the Big Bang and black holes? In this talk I will discuss how the largest supercomputers in the world allow astrophysicists to gain insights into the workings of the universe around us. \n\nJD Emberson is an Astrophysics PhD student at the University of Toronto. His work involves using supercomputers to study the structure of the universe on large scales and at early times in its history.\n\n----\n\nPresentation 2:\"So long, and thanks for all the pink\"\n\nMen are from Mars and Women are from Venus, or so they say - but are we really so different? We will explore sex and gender, and how our conceptions of the differences between boys and girls have changed over the past 3000 years (or so). We'll look at how societal expectations and marketing have shaped our views on what is and isn't appropriate for boys and girls - including, but certainly not limited to, which colours they should wear!\n\nDr. Jenn Neilson has a PhD in philosophy specializing in gender norms, from the University of Texas at Austin. She is the founder of Jill and Jack Kids, a clothing company that's inspiring the next generation of leaders to think beyond pink and blue. She is also co-organizer of Versatile PhD Toronto, a networking community for recovering academics.\n\n----\n\nPresentation 3: \"I want to do EVERYTHING (Life as a Polymath)\"\n\nWhen you meet new people for the first time and they ask you what you do, do you have a dozen different answers?

Assembled over centuries during the Islamic Golden Age, this collection of Arabic fairy tales was translated into English in 1706 and have come to be known to western audiences as \u201cArabian Nights\u201d.  The tales are told by Sherehezade, the latest bride of King Shahryar during her wedding night.  Her goal: to save herself from her own execution the next morning by captivating her husband with her fantastical and eccentric tales.  Filled with action, mystery, jealousy, sex and romance, these stories are brought to life through the beautiful art of belly dance.  A feast for the senses, Arabian Nights will transport you to exotic lands and times with enthralling music, colourful costuming, dramatic storytelling and exotic belly dance.  Come away with Sarah Skinner and the Sisters of Salome and let them \u2018tell you a story\u2019  at  The Toronto Fringe  Festival July 2-13 2014.

I have a few but it would be good to bring them along if possible for your comfort.\n\nDetails:\n\nSaturday April 5\n1-4 p.m.\n\n90 Sumach Street\nEntry Code 650\nSuite 521\n\nmy cel: 647-620-1222\nFree: By Donation\n\n(Suggested: Share What Your Being is Comfortable with)\n\n------------------------------------------\n\na short video with updates: http://youtu.be/Rm8_m2tEjvs \n\n\nFreedom is so simple that most of the people totally miss the significance of it. Freedom is free, but not cheap, so if you want to afford freedom you have to give up everything, which creates fear in you, since you don't want to give up everything. But in order to keep freedom you have give up everything and give up even the freedom itself only then you can have freedom though it can not be kept, only you can be kept in freedom, because this is your natural way of being. Completely free, boundless and limitless, infinitely so.\n\n \n\nI invite you to explore and look with your own eyes and experience to something overlooked so greatly. Your liberation is in your own hands now, and it's certainly very simple to recognize as your own seeing once you can to places like this meeting.\n\n \n\nHow many practices and years of different traditions, rituals and exercises spent chasing the freedom? Total freedom. Absolute Liberation.\n\nHow many of these practices actually did set you free? Not simply made you chains less tight, but really can you confirm that they totally chopped the heavy chains holding you stuck to something, without the complete freedom from all?\n\n \n\nYour coming here will result in absolute freeing of your being :]\n\n \n\nIsn't so that every practice, ritual, technique strives to reach the place where no more practice is needed, but it eventually becomes your natural way of being?\n\n \n\nIf you have a sense that it is your time to come into your own Absolute, Total, and Complete Freedom and You Can Handle Your Own Eternal Freedom, come and rest into your natural way of liberated being.\n\n \n\nCome into your Wholeness and Freedom Today ;]\n\n \n\n------------------------------------------\n\nFor more info, please feel free to visit the following:\nOfficial Website: www.thepowerwith.in\n\n3 Steps to Enlightenment Program [Free to Download]: http://goo.gl/aUGpAF\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thepowin\n\nThePowerWith.in Family: https://www.facebook.com/groups/tpwfamily\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/PowerWithinBlog\n\nYouTube: www.youtube.com/OfficialPowerWithin\n\nWhat other people say? :\n\nHi Rimvi,\nI find all the meetings delightful. I often feel as if we are all sitting around a campfire, eating chocs, watching the sun set, the sky darken and the stars emerge. The interactions among everyone who attends is respectful and comfortable. Not that it matters to me, but it is a \"safe\" place to express all kinds of emotions and thoughts. Nobody is judge. Nobody is police. Personally, each meeting reminds me of things that I've put aside for various uninteresting reasons. Attachments to any belief, thought or illusion are revealed for what they are: constructs and illusions. Like a snake shedding its skin, these attachments  itch, and irritate, until the old skin is torn away. Perhaps it is a process of de-evolution: unmasking the pointless nonsense we tend to believe is true. Whatever it is, it is good. All good. Thank you. -K.E. Jones\n\nThank you so much Rimvi for these meet ups. I was on a spiritual journey for a while looking to find something and you helped me find my true self which I was like ,whooooaah!.....it was mind blowing ... i cried.. i laughed... im still surprised....but im sooo deeply humbled and grateful that you were the one to make me see...my whole life has shifted so much for the better and I m not lost anymore. Im home... I... am... home.....Keep up the truth and love Rimvi! Your heart is a big one...See you in the next meet up and looking forward to seeing new faces. It's time for more people to hear what is shared in this group...just Golden...no words to express......language limits us....the truth is too great...I love it!  - Lisa\n\nHi Rimvi\nI would just like to say that I found your approach very refreshing in its simplicity. After all, why make anything complicated? I found your group to be a pleasant learning experience - a good place to connect with like minded people. Thank you for continuing to offer this space for people to learn how to just BE.  - Sue\n\nHi Rimvi,You asked for feedback...The fastback is that everything happens as it supposed. You do what you must do, and other people do what they must do.Do I like it? YesIs it useful? Yes, it is the only place which I know about which produces awakened people, real ones. And it does that without years of meditation practice, etc. It is a very honest place, where lies not presented, but instead lies are busted. No religious beliefs, not a sect, just a group of people working to discover the truth.About the rest we discussed in our one on one meetings.Cheers, - Radim\n\nI truly enjoyed the creative and relaxed atmosphere of the event I attended, and I know it's quite different from other events out there (refreshingly different!!!) - Laura\n\nLife is transformed because I understand suffering as I witness the mind. As i understand suffering, i let go of suffering. As i let go of suffering i become peaceful. - Elaine H.",

Since meeting the two have teamed up on numerous productions including bootlegs of multiple tracks. In December of 2013 the two decided it was time to team up and create music under the moniker Ronnie & Wylde. In January of 2014 they released their bootleg of \"Mastodon\" by Milk N Cookies which gained numerous blog support and over 8,000 plays in just over week and followed with an 7 stop international tour, hitting Canada and the US supporting Milk N Cookies.\n\nIndividually have toured all over the North America, including stops in major cities in Ontario, Florida, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia and Punta Cana.

        "description": "March 1st, 2014 was a national day call for action against the Harper government. It was a response by the Canadian public, who demonstrated in more than 35 marches across the country, who do not support the Harper government\u2019s various changes to legislation, particularly OMNIBUS BILLS, such as C-38, which encompasses changes to 70 laws.\n\nThese laws weaken our environmental legislation and violate the federal government\u2019s obligation to consult with Aboriginal communities. Harper uses omnibus bills as a ploy to group together multiple reforms to our government which circumvent our Democracy and gut our environmental protection laws.\n\nFurthermore, another facet to this grand scheme is to alter our democratic process; with Bill C-23, the so-called \u2018Fair\u2019 Elections Act. \u201cThe proposed Bill C-23 is an attempt by Conservatives to suppress the voting rights of students, seniors, and Aboriginal peoples; with bill C-18, Canadian Farmers will lose the right to save, store, sell & reuse farm-saved seeds.\u201d He has already dismantled the Canada Wheat Board. The list goes on.....\n\nThere is a tremendous lack of accountability within our current government. It is time for Canadians to unite and stand up for our rights, our children\u2019s rights, and the future of Canada before we have nothing left.\n\nThe Harper government has established a pattern of muzzling government scientists & closed down the Sciences Libraries in a Hitler type action.\n\nInformation and programs lost included the Marine Programs such Marine Biology and others such as the Fisheries & Oceans .... main in the Atlantic provinces. This has resulted in loss of species & putting other species At Risk .\n\nHarper promised to transform Canada so it would not be recognizable, and he has been doing his best to keep that promise with secretly-negotiated neoliberal free trade deals and corporate protection pacts (the TPP, the Canada-EU CETA, numerous FIPAs), which focus on increasing corporate rights (including compensation for so-called \u201clost profits\u201d), privatization, austerity and greatly reduced environmental standards, while requiring governments to open up public services, education, health care, & water resources (among other things) to foreign transnational corporations to purchase and operate as for-profit businesses, or risk being sued. Canada is losing its sovereignty!\n\nDemocracy needs our protection and participation. When we look the other way or assume democracy is safe, people like Mr. Harper start chipping away at the edges and before we know it fascists will be changing laws quietly. Stealing our democracy wrecking our environment, poisoning our water, air and food.\n\nPM Harper needs to be held accountable for several \u201cActs of Contempt\u201d against Canadians, our Constitutional Rights, and our Democracy:\n\n\u2022 Election Fraud, which makes him an \u201cIllegitimate\u201d Prime Minister.\n\u2022 Senate Scandal \u2013 proven cover up, lies and corruption in Harper\u2019s PMO\n\u2022 Abuse of proroguing powers to avoid Parliamentary discussion. Four times!\n\u2022 The Illegal misuse of the $15 million G-8 legacy fund.\n\u2022 Omnibus Bills to prevent Parliamentary debate for new laws and to hide legislation, while being fast tracked.\n\u2022 Stripping protection from 99% of Canada\u2019s 2.5 million rivers and lakes. In 2012 just 82 (1 %!) remained protected.\n\u2022 Abuse of the Temporary Foreign Workers program.\n\u2022 Currently has the record number of laws struck down by the courts as \u201cunconstitutional \u201c - and still counting....\n\u2022 Privacy breeches like internet searches and phone tapping without warrants.\n\u2022 $3.1 billion anti-terrorist fund \u201clost.\u201d\n\u2022 Corporate tax cuts of over $500 billion.\n\u2022 Bill C-60 allows Harper unprecedented control over CBC workers and news programs. Controlling the freedoms of the press and freedom of speech.\n\u2022 Increased OAS eligibility to age 67.\n\u2022 Food inspection cuts & promoting GMOs.\n\u2022 Cuts to Health care funding across Canada.\n\u2022 7000% increase in advertising budgets for Natural Resources Canada.\n\u2022 $114 billion to bailout banks during a recession, even though the banks showed a profit and were in no danger of going bankrupt.\n\u2022 Dismantled National Child Care in favor of $100-a-month to parents.\n\u2022 Shown complete Disregard and Disrespect for our honored Veterans.\n\u2022 Completely disrespects our Aboriginal communities by dishonoring Treaties.\n\u2022 Raised the net tax burden on Canadians an extra $75 million.\n\nSTOP THE HARPER REGIME NOW!!!\n\nOn Dec 4, 2012 Canada had 2.5 million Protected Rivers and Lakes - On Dec 5, 2012 Canada had 82 Protected Rivers and Lakes.\n\nMay 1st thru May 4th 2014\n\nLET US UNITE! LET US STAND UP FOR OUR RIGHTS!\nWAKE UP ! RISE UP !",

In this special concert, Sultans of String meet the electricity of sitar master Anwar Khurshid.  Anwar's music has been featured in Oscar-winning film Life of Pi as well as The Love Guru and Kama Sutra, besides performances in Europe, North America and Asia.\n\nKnown for dizzying roots music jams, poly-rhythms and revved up riffs, the Sultans of String sound can't be pinned down -- it's Sable Island meets the Silk Road, with detours through the Gypsy-Jazz coffeehouses of Eastern Europe, next an East Coast Kitchen Party, over to the majestic Arctic, then to the bustling markets of Lebanon. Fiery violin dances with rumba-flamenco guitar while a funk bass lays down unstoppable grooves. Throughout acoustic strings meet electronic wizardry to create layers and depths of sound. Since their formation 6 years ago, Sultans of String have been riding a wave of success, hitting #1 on world/international music charts in Canada, a JUNO nomination, 2 Canadian Folk Music Awards and 1st prize in the International Songwriting Contest (out of 15,000 entries). They have just released their new, roots-worldbeat-symphonic mash-up, Symphony!, featuring The Chieftains\u2019 very own Paddy Moloney, folk-pop darlings Dala, ukulele giant James Hill, and other special guests. Symphony! is distributed across North America on Red River through SONY, and is available on iTunes and at http://www.sultansofstring.com). Check out their official video, called \u201cLuna\u201d:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uSEI4zRxLM.\n\nPart of #SWAMS14 \nPresented in association with Small World Music Society",

(In partnership with Fight Network's LAST TO TAP)\n \nDIVISIONS:\n- All weight divisions as per IBJJF standards\n \nWEIGH INS:\n- Everyone can weigh in between 8am & 11am the day of the event. This allows for competitors to re-hydrate and eat for their fights\n- If you miss this time slot, competitors may weigh in between 12pm & 1pm\n \nEARLY REGISTRATION CLOSE DATE:\n- May 5th 2014\n \nREGISTRATION CLOSES:\n- May 16th 2014\n \nWATCH OUR PROMO VIDEO HERE!\nhttp://youtu.be/nkBRm99w9qk\n \n**********MYSTERY BAGS**********\n \nToronto Classic will be giving out 100 mystery bags to the first 100 registers with over $10,000 worth of prizes!\n \nThese bags will be available for you to physically choose from at the event. The bags will contain random prizes from our sponsors such as Gameness, Break Point, Hayabusa, Venum, PreFight, MaxSweat, Defense Soap and the Fight Network. \n \n*****TWO $200 SUBMISSION OF THE NIGHT AWARDS*****\n \nThere is keen interest, more than ever, from companies & television networks in finding Canada's best submission fighters. In order to facilitate this process, the CBJJF & Neojits will have a staff of camera operators for each individual ring, & each individual match. The CBJJF is the first to ever do it this way.\n \nA team of 5, which include a black, brown & purple belt will review all the submissions and filter them down to 5 from male adult and 5 from women adult divisions. (if you would like to join the team to filter submissions email info@neojits.com to inquire)\n \nOnce the fighters are nominated via video, the jiujitsu community will vote online for who they deem to have the best submission.\n \nThe criteria used for filtering down submissions include, but not limited to:\n1. How fast did the submission happen?\n2. How close to the bell did the submission happen?\n3. How difficult is that submission to apply?\n4. How technical & smooth was the submission?\n5. Was there a significant weight difference?\n \nPlease note that we are doing this because we want to help you enjoy your jiujitsu journey and because we want to find the HIDDEN TALENT companies, sponsors & networks want. However, safety is our number one priority. Toronto Classic is very happy and proud to say that the head of the Canadian Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation - CBJJF John Davies is notorious and very much respected for the dedication and emphasis he places on the safety and overall well being of his competitors. Oss.\n\n                **********LAST TO TAP**********\n\nLast To Tap is a Submission Fighting Reality TV Show to be aired late 2014 in over 30 countries (updated from 8) on the Fight Network.\n\nBrazilian jiujitsu & submission fighting is spreading like an epidemic all over the world with virtually a new brand or school opening every single week, if not more. \n\nThis is great news! \n\nWhy? Because it shows that the sport we love is finally catching on, both in raw global awareness and in the business world. At the end of the day, we are all one global jiujitsu community and should celebrate the successes and advances of every brand, affiliation & organization. A perfect example of this is the amazing community focused bjj Podcast JUST THE GI TOP (fb.com/justthegitop).\n\nHowever, there are good & bad news.\n\nThe bad news is... the general population still doesn't understand grappling.\n\nTo the general population, submission fighting still looks a bit strange & only a small percentage of MMA fight fans (who don't train) truly understand jiujitsu for what it is.\n\nOnly if you train and experience it will you understand how life changing it is.\nOnly if you train and experience it will you understand how profoundly vast the martial art really is.\nOnly if you train and experience it will you understand how efficient and humbling it is.\n\nwhich means...\n\nOnly if you train and experience it will you understand why it's creating businesses and academies globally the way it is. \n\nThe good news is...  LAST TO TAP is looking to change precisely that.\n\nLast to Tap will show the world:\nWHY we live, breath and eat Brazilian jiujitsu.\nWHY we become so emotionally, physically and spiritually involved with submission fighting.\nWHY some of us are willing to risk EVERYTHING, to make jiujitsu a part of our daily life.\n\nAll, through the lives and experiences of 16 of the most decorated up and coming submission fighters out of Canada. \n\nYes, it's finally our time.\n\nFor more info & interest to participate in up and coming auditions at OPEN MAT MMA in Toronto this April visit www.lasttotaptv.com \n\nDo you truly love jiujitsu? Do you want to be involved with jiujitsu full time? Are you doing well in competition?\nLast to Tap wants to hear from you.\n\nAuditions for Montreal Quebec TBA.",

        "description": "Dear friends,\n\nWe're going to celebrate the Indian spring festival of Holi at this coming satsang regardless of how much more snow we get before this winter is finally spent! For those of you who have not experienced the festival, the primary ingredient is coloured powder.  We'll put a couple of white sheets down, and anyone who wishes to be daubed or to daub someone else can stand on the sheet to indicate their willingness to play! If you don't get near the sheet you'll remain colour-free. But it is fun and many get sucked in by the end, even if it's just a small smear of purple on the cheek. Wear clothes you don't mind getting soiled.\n\nMiranda and I enjoyed one of the first days of our honeymoon in Rajasthan, in March 2004, caught up in a swirl of Holi play. There wasn't another adult woman to be found anywhere and I was very nervous for my new bride and even more so for her Nikon camera every time she manually changed a roll of film amidst clouds of red and green dust. In more urban areas of India the women get involved. Once I was the recipient of a bucket full of coloured water dumped on my head, while a 90 year old grandmother, coloured up from head to toe, stood by laughing her head off before giving me her blessing with some more powder.\n\nWe are taught by example of our Satguru Yeshu to rejoice with those who rejoice and mourn with those who mourn. To get more wine, when the wine runs out and not worry about what religious people may think! To dive in and get involved with the world and it's celebrations. And while doing so to be filled with God's love.\nIn that Spirit we welcome (and long for) the coming of Spring.  \n\nThe following satsang will be on Good Friday, April 18th. We will be conducting a Maha Prasad (breaking of the coconut to symbolize the sacrificial death of Christ on the cross).\n\nblessings,\n\nChris and Miranda\n\n\n\n-----------------------\n\nYeshu Satsang\n\n \n\nFriday, March 21st, 2014\n\n7 pm\n\nChurch of the Resurrection\n\n1100 Woodbine Avenue\n\nToronto, ON, M4C 4C7",

Hydrofluorosilicic Acid is a toxic waste by-product of phosphate fertilizer production that is used to fluoridate Toronto's public water supply. In addition to Fluoride, it contains toxic chemical elements, such as lead, arsenic, mercury and radioactive substances. \n\n2.) The largest U.S. study comparing tooth decay between those drinking fluoridated vs. non-fluoridated water found a non-significant gain of 0.6 of a surface of a tooth (out of 128 tooth surfaces) for those drinking fluoridated water (Brunelle & Carlos, 1990). Other research shows that there is no relation between dental carries and the amount of Fluoride ingested ( Warren et al., 2009). \n\n3.) Consumption of artificially fluoridated water has also been associated with lowered IQ, bone cancer in boys, skeletal and dental fluorosis, hypothyroidism, kidney disease, and other adverse health effects.\nFor specific studies pertaining to these adverse health effects visit www.FluorideAlert.org or www.cof-cof.ca\n\n4.) Forcing the public to consume fluoridated water infringes on their right to informed consent\n\nwww.EndFluorideToronto.com",

        "description": "Presented by Bum Chic Productions\n\nContemporary Musical Theatre Songs by Kerrigan & Lowdermilk\n\nKait Kerrigan (words) and Brian Lowdermilk (music) made their off-Broadway debut in 2006 with their adaptation of Henry and Mudge. Other musicals include The Unauthorized Autobiography of Samantha Brown, Tales From The Bad Years, The Woman Upstairs, Wrong Number, The Freshman Experiment, Republic and Flash of Time. Their first album, Our First Mistake (2011), charted at #1 on the iTunes Singer/Songwriter chart; their new album, Kerrigan-Lowdermilk Live (2013), documents a concert tour that resulted from their breakout $35K kickstarter. Among them, they have received the 2009 Kleban Award, 2006 Larson Award, 2005 Richard Rodgers Award, and 2004-2005 Dramatists Guild Fellowship. They have held residencies at the Orchard Project and the MacDowell Arts Colony. www.kerrigan-lowdermilk.com. \n\nPARTY WORTH CRASHING is a special concert of songs from Kerrigan & Lowdermilk's musicals. It's a show about youth, coming of age, and learning lessons. It\u2019s about laughing at yourself, and figuring things out on your own. It\u2019s about realizing that with the freedom to do anything comes the responsibility to do something. \n\nCAST: \nAlisha Ruiss \nBenjamin Joseph Harris \nBryna Weiss \nJon Corkal \nMarc Ducusin \nRachel Resnik \n\nMusical Director/Piano: Sean Mayes \n\nThe Band \nKeith Melanson\nMatthew Machanda\nAndrew Ascenzo\nMeghan Cheng\n\nTICKETS: $12 Advance at www.ticketscene.ca/events/10196  \n$15 at the door \n\n#PWCToronto",

Only one problem, hobnobbing with Rob Ford and Justin Trudeau has its risks and they get caught smoking the pot by the po-po. With Harper's 'tough on crime' agenda, this minor offence lands them in the slammer. What's more... Harper budget cuts and his fear of a Canadian 'Pussy Riot' have led to the world\u2019s first co-ed kind-of-like-res-but-in-lockdown federal prison. There, they meet the women from The Orange is the New Black and learn what it really means to 'drop the moisturizer'. \n\nWill they discover the extent of Warden Harper's plan before it threatens the lives of every clean air loving, green party voting, marijuana smoking, left-leaning pinko in Canada?

        "description": "Thank you to everyone who came out to Empty The Tanks 2013! \n\nPlease save the date May 24, 2014 \n\nJust in the planning stages - More info to follow soon\n\nFacts...\nApproximately 17 dolphin family members are killed for every one dolphin sold (for ~$200,000) to Seaworld, Marineland and all the other Marine Abusement Parks that hold cetaceans captive for our entertainment. \n\nIf there is no demand, there will be no Slaughter.\nFor the Dolphin Slaughter to end, people actually have to do Nothing! They just have to NOT buy a ticket! \n\nDolphins & Whales\n\n\u2022\tThere are currently 42 orcas being held captive worldwide.\n\n\u2022\tAt least 136 wild orcas have been taken into captivity from the wild since 1961. \n\n\u2022\t123 of these (or 90.4%) orcas are now dead.\n\n\u2022\tOrcas & Dolphins are self aware and have language. \n\n\u2022\tDolphin calves call their mothers \u2018by name\u2019. Dolphin friends call each other by name.\n\n\u2022\tDolphins are altruistic. They will not leave a family member in distress and have often rescued humans and other predator species\n\n\u2022\tScientists say that due to their high intelligence and complex social structure, dolphins should be designated as non-human persons with rights \n\n\u2022\tIn the wild, Orcas live as long or longer than humans\n              In captivity, their lives are cut toless than half that.\n\n\u2022\tDolphins live 25-50 years in the wild, but only average 5 yrs. in captivity\n\n\u2022\tDolphin sons never leave their mother\u2019s side their entire lives\n\u2022\tOrca offspring never leave their mothers side their entire lives.  \n\n\u2022\tApproximately 1,000 Dolphins are inhumanely slaughtered in Taiji every year.\n\n\u2022\tOf those, 250 are selected for captivity. The rest will be butchered for their meat which is extremely toxic with mercury.\n\n\u2022\tCaptive Dolphins sell for $150,000 or more to Seaquariums making this at least a $40 million per year business for Taiji. \n\n\u2022\t53% of captured dolphins will die within 3 months of confinement.\n\n\n\u2022\tFood is withheld from Orcas & Dolphins to ensure they perform\n\n\u2022\tMany are on medications their whole lives\n\n\u2022\tOrcas & Dolphins are forced to inbreed. Mothers often reject captive born babies bred from close relatives.\n\u2022\tWild Orcas swim up to 100 miles/day\n\u2022\tWild dolphins swim up to 40 miles/day\n\nIt would take 5,000 endless circles per day to swim that far in a tank\n\n\nFrom September 1st, 2012  -  Feb. 25, 2013:\n\n\t1,486 dolphins were driven into the cove in Taiji, Japan. \n\no\t899 were killed\no\t247 were live-capture.\n\no\t340  survivors were released\n\no\tDolphin meat sold as food is highly toxic with mercury\n\n\t\nDolphins struggle in pain and terror while they are bludgeoned, stabbed, suffocated and sliced open, still alive.  It is NOT a quick death. Family members stuggle to rescue their loved ones until it\u2019s their turn.  \nThose selected for captivity swim in their family's blood watching the horror. \nStill in shock, captive dolphins are trained by starvation to do tricks for food. \n\nCaptive dolphins who would swim 40 miles per day in the wild, hunting fresh fish are confined to a tiny chlorinated pool & fed dead fish, destined to entertain or \u2018swim with\u2019 humans to survive, never seeing their pod again.  \nDolphin Sonar, a useful tool in the wild, disorients them as it bounces off the concrete pool walls. It\u2019s like living in a hall of mirrors.\n\nThey become neurotic and depressed and agressively frustrated.\n\n3 trainers have been killed by Orcas so far and numerous attacks have been recorded.\n\nDolphins in captivity die from capture shock, pneumonia, intestinal disease, ulcers, chlorine poisoning, and other stress-related illnesses. To the captive dolphin industry, these facts are accepted as routine operating expenses.\n\nThe only way to learn about dolphin habits is in the wild. They don't have any natural habits in captivity.\n\nEverytime someone buys a ticket to a marine abusement park, they support the slaughter of these family-oriented, sentient beings.\n\n\nThe only way to close their doors for good is to get the general public to stop buying tickets. We need your voice, your posters, and your dedication to seeing an end to the captivity industry.\n\n EMPTY THE TANKS!\n\n**Please only RSVP to the events you are going to attend and contact the email below if you are interested in holding a Empty the Tanks protest in your town!!!!

We can debate five ways to Sunday on what the city needs but we'd all agree that you can never have enough love. \n\nIf you've felt the urge to take action, especially leading up to the fall civic elections, consider this a starting point to learn about the options on what type of action you can take. \n\nAnd if you'd like to share your project with the crowd to rally support and inspire, drop one of the event organizers a line and we'll take it from there.",

(For tickets visit http://www.utrafundraiser.eventbee.com)\n\nPlease join us for dinner, music, art, and drinks on March 19 as we strive to do our bit for the plight facing refugees around the world. All proceeds from the event will be directed to the Syrian refugee crisis, through the Red Crescent (Red Cross), as well as to the Scarborough Community Volunteer Clinic, in keeping with our tradition of contributing locally.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to network with like-minded individuals to discuss and raise awareness about the innumerable problems encountered, both while seeking refuge and in host countries, by increasing refugee populations. More importantly, the perfect opportunity for all of us to help make a difference for the lives of refugees. We hope to see you there!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Xiaq5dilRg\n\n\nStudent tickets: $30\nGeneral tickets: $40\nTickets can be purchased from:\nhttp://www.utrafundraiser.eventbee.com\n\nIf you are not able to attend this event but still want to contribute, you can make a donation at the link above as well.\n\n\nGuest Speakers:\n\nRima Kamal has been a delegate with the International Committee of the Red Cross for over 7 years. Her ICRC missions included Syria, Iraq, Jerusalem and Jordan.  During this time, she was a protection delegate working to uphold the rights of detainees and document violations of International Humanitarian Law. More recently, she was ICRC's spokesperson and head of its communication department in Syria. Previously, she worked as a consular officer for the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (2004-2006) in Jerusalem and Los Angeles. She holds an M.A. in Political Science from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.\n\nDr. Paul Caulford is the Medical Director of the Scarborough Community Volunteer Clinic for medically uninsured immigrants and refugees. He is the Lead Physician and President of the Scarborough Academic Family Health Team in Toronto and is also an Assistant Professor in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the University of Toronto. \nRead more about his work and findings here:\nhttp://www.cfp.ca/content/58/7/725.full#corresp-1\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3681469/\n\n\nWhere the money is going:\n\n1. In 2011, a civil war broke out in Syria. Since then, there have been approximately 2.5 million Syrian refugees. The UN estimates that there will be more than 5 million Syrian refugees by the end of 2014. Red Crescent works to build secure refugee camps for the Syrian refugees inside and out of the country's borders. Essential needs, such as shelter and field hospitals, are provided for the refugees through Red Crescent.\n\n2. In Canada, thousands of refugees and immigrants arrive and are denied basic and urgent healthcare. After being exposed to and escaping war and oppression, thousands of Canada's newcomers find themselves once again facing hurdles- within our healthcare system. Scarborough Community Volunteer Clinic provides free primary healthcare for medically uninsured refugees and immigrants in Canada.",

His virtuosity is matched only by his understanding and respect of his heritage. A graduate of Ferenc Liszt Academy of Music of Budapest, he has completed many successful tours throughout the world with various ensembles, including well over a dozen tours in North America. The cimbalom, a sort of oversized hammer dulcimer played with mallets like a vibraphone, possesses piano like percussive abilities to drive a band rhythmically or take the melodic lead. In K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Balogh's expert hands, the cimbalom can do both simultaneously. His mastery of this unique and rare Hungarian folk instrument has mesmerized audiences.\nK\u00e1lm\u00e1n Balogh Gypsy Cimbalom Trio is the dynamic merging of music from the old and new worlds. Balogh continues a fabled European musical tradition harking back to the collaboration of masters like gypsy guitarist Django Reinhardt and violinist Stephane Grappelli, connecting ancient folk music traditions of Central and Eastern Europe with the chord progressions and swinging rhythm of jazz. Balogh's cimbalom becomes a new and compelling voice centering the Trio, which is enhanced by acoustic violin/viola and acoustic bass. Similarities in jazz and traditional folk music, such as improvisation and a kaleidoscope of emotional expressions, are immediately evident.\nThe Trio includes excellent musicians who have worked with Balogh extensively. Robert Lakatos, a viola and violin player from Slovakia, is steeped in classical music training and played with important classical orchestras, but always gravitated toward folk and world music. He plays in several groups ranging from classical to folk and jazz genres. Robert\u2019s band, the R\u00c9V, has become a popular band in Hungary and Slovakia. Bassist Csaba Nov\u00e1k is one of the most versatile bass players in Hungary, familiar with gypsy style, klezmer, folk music, jazz and world music.\nMelodies polished in European villages for centuries are interpreted with great respect and understanding by trio, enabling present day music lovers to experience the emotions and beauty inherent in the music of our ancestors. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Balogh Cimbalom Trio brings a contemporary and uniquely forward-looking edge to time-honored traditions, leaving audiences enthralled and inspired.",

        "description": "**Join us for the Toronto premiere of SILENCE IS GOLD, a film that explores the state of free-speech in a corporate dominated world. This screening is co-presented with the NFB - National Film Board of Canada, MiningInjustice Solidarity Network,  protestbarrick.net and Point of View Magazine. Sakura Saunders and guest speakers will be in attendance.\n\nSILENCE IS GOLD\nJulien Fr\u00e9chette / Canada / 2012 / 77 ' / French / S.T. English\n\nWhat are the limits to freedom of speech? Can we put a price on our spoken and written words? Following the 2008 release of the book Noir Canada, author Alain Deneault, his co-writers and his publisher, E\u0301ditions E\u0301cosocie\u0301te\u0301, grappled with these questions \u2013 at great personal expense \u2013 after being sued for defamation in Quebec and Ontario courts by two large Canadian mining companies. Deneault and his publisher fought back, becoming entangled in a seemingly never-ending spiral of judicial proceedings. Silence Is Gold is a thriller of a documentary that tells their story, set against the backdrop of the Canadian justice system. We follow the complex procedural twists and turns, eagerly anticipating a resolution that is repeatedly delayed.\n\nFilmmaker Julien Fre\u0301chette\u2019s camera and questions lead us through this little- understood legal territory without judging or wading into the merits of the cases. His gaze is both subtle and attentive as he tactfully immerses himself in the story, initiating a dialogue with Alain Deneault, who becomes the protagonist of the film. Silence Is Gold raises crucial questions about Canada\u2019s role and responsibilities in the global mining sector, the limits of free speech and equitable access to the Canadian justice system.\n\ncinemapolitica.org/bloor",

        "description": "* Committed to social change and a better world?\n* Interested in connecting with like-minded people in a deeper way?\n* Need a pause from the daily grind to reflect and regroup?\n\n... Come to the Jam!  \n\n(Info & application here, due March 15! http://www.yesworld.org/torontojam/)\n\n=========\n*** What\u2019s the Jam? ***\n \nThink of when musicians get together to jam. They meet, experiment and play off of one another, and create beautiful new music. Now imagine instead of music, it was ideas and experiences being shared. Jams are open-ended and unscripted gatherings of 30 or so changemakers (ages ~18-40) who spend a week reflecting, sharing, building community, and creating new possibilities.\n \n*** Why should I not miss this? ***\n \nOn a daily basis, many of us do too much and pause too little. Rarely do we get to step back and really check in with ourselves and with each other.\n \nThe Jam is an opportunity to have those authentic conversations we may not usually get to have: About the dreams that drive the work we do, the struggles that we move through, and the magic that keeps us going.\n \n*** Is the Jam for you? ***\n \nDo you have a relationship to social change (as an activist, artist, healer, parent, entrepreneur, community worker, or any other way)\u2026 Do you want to consciously evolve your work and your role? Then, Yes!\n \nDo you have a relationship to community\u2026 Do you want to cultivate honesty, authenticity, vulnerability, openness to solving conflicts, and non-violence\u2026 Do you want to dream bigger or connect more across issues and communities? Then, Yes!\n \nDo you have a relationship to yourself\u2026 Whether \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019 at self-care, do you struggle or feel ease with your relationship to yourself\u2026 Do you want to develop a kinder, truer connection to yourself? Then, Yes!\n \n*** What happens at a Jam? ***\n \nTake what you think you know about conferences, retreats, and symposiums and throw it out the window. Each Jam is unique, but you can expect a blend of facilitated dialogue, reflection, play and movement, artistic expression, deep inquiry, games, music, and meaning-making.\n \nA Jam works on three different levels of change: the internal, the interpersonal, and the systemic.\n \nOn the internal level: we give ourselves space to reflect on our personal stories, learn and unlearn, take off our masks, seek our next growing edge, recharge, and renew.\n \nOn an interpersonal level, we come together to discover common grounds and celebrate differences. We take time for authentic conversations to bridge our divides (race, class, gender, etc), and take an honest, courageous, and loving look at our conflicts and relationships with one another.\n \nOn a systemic level, we link issues that aren\u2019t commonly linked to find new intersection points and gain a clearer vision of the whole. We examine our work and role within the bigger picture, and deepen our capacity to affect meaningful change upon leaving the Jam.    \n\n*** Who else comes to Jam? ***\nJams are for everyone.  The beauty of the jam lies in the mix of people who show up.\n\nWe look for a vibrant diversity in\u2026\n\u2026 experience (from 'just starting out' to 'been at it for years')\n\u2026 roles (from 'person on the ground' to 'director and founder'; from 'entrepreneur' to 'non-profit' to 'healer' to 'philanthropist' to 'parent' to 'organizer' to 'urban farmer' \u2013 to so much more)\n\u2026 passions and focus (education, immigration, technology, food security, health, arts, labour, green architecture, indigenous issues, community media, trauma recovery, globalization, etc. etc.)\n\u2026 identities and worldviews (e.g. class, race, religion, sexuality, gender, age, dis/ability, ethnicity, etc.)\nYou can read more about past Jams and other Jams worldwide here.\n\n*** Who\u2019s behind the Toronto Jam 2014? ***\n\nThe Toronto Jam is organized and facilitated by a dynamic team of Toronto community changemakers (all YES! Jam Alumni): \nLisa Thacker, Brigid Tierney, Karen B.K. Chan, Rehana Tejpar, Pauline Sok Yin Hwang, Adeline Cohen, nisha ahuja, plus Shilpa Jain from YES. \n\n*** How much will this cost? ***\n\nWe never want money to be a barrier in participating in a Jam, so we will do everything we can to make it work for you to attend.\n\nTuition for the Jam is $550, most of which covers food and lodging, and some of which covers program expenses. Some partial scholarships are available by request, and based on need. Payment plans (e.g. making a monthly payment over the year) can be arranged as well. Additional donations are welcome and tax deductible! They help us provide scholarships and ensure that the group is as diverse as possible. We ask people to consider a minimum contribution of $320 to cover hard costs of food and accommodation. We invite work trades as well. Participants are responsible for travel to the retreat center, though we can help arrange carpools. \n\n*** Can I bring my kid? ***\n\nWe can work with you to make arrangements for childcare. Please let us know if you have this need, so we can explore possibilities together.\n\n*** Is the space wheelchair accessible? ***\n\nThe main floor of the retreat centre, including the common area, is wheelchair-accessible. Please contact us for details.\n\nSee http://www.yesworld.org/torontojam/ for more info and to apply. Deadline is March 15, 2014!",

        "description": "(version fran\u00e7aise apr\u00e8s le texte anglais)\n\nHi Everyone,\n\nThere has been a complicated and unplanned situation involving Kinetik Production that as of this week has become insurmountable. Unfortunately because of the confidential nature of the case, it\u2019s impossible to go into details, but you need to know that we are now facing issues that have a major effect on the continuation of the Kinetik Festival. After consulting council and looking at all possible options, we sadly have to close down Kinetik Productions and put an end to the Kinetik Festival.\n\nFor everyone that knows me more personally, you know that the Kinetik Festival has been my \u2018\u2019life\u2019\u2019 for more than 8 years and it is with no small consideration or regret that I put an end to this project. But with the threat of the ongoing issue, it was now more than possible that the 7.0 couldn't happen next May. We are aware of the effect this could have on people traveling to the festival and on all the fans that will not be able to see the bands that were booked for Kinetik 7.0, but we want to ensure that we are capable of issuing refunds on all the online tickets purchases, so our only option was canceling Kinetik now. We are not a ''big'' productions company like in mainstream music; being a non profit company, the one and only event that we produce is the Kinetik Festival, and tickets sales have always been the only source of income. We hope you will understand that this was the best and only way to get out of this terrible situation, while still being able to refund everyone in the shortest period possible.\n\nThis ongoing situation has nothing to do with the Toronto venue and or with the Kinetik Festival partners that have shown nothing but full support for the festival. We are also presently working with some partners in Toronto so some of the shows (the ones that were part of tours) still happen and that Toronto fans still have a chance  to see those excellent bands. We will post more about this as soon we have more information about it.\n\nRefunds will start today, going backward month by month, since paypal offers full refunds on the newest transactions. When we are at the transactions not covered by the paypal full refund, we will contact you so you can confirm that we can issue refunds on the original transaction via your original transaction record. We will post updates here on the Facebook page to inform you where we are up to with the refunds. Be sure to look in your inbox for an email from  ''sales@festival-kinetik.net'' to be sure to receive your refund.\n\nOnce again, this is really not our hope for how the 7.0 edition would turn out, and we hope that you will understand that this action is a last recourse after considering many options.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nBonjour \u00e0 tous,\n\nSuite \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e8nement impr\u00e9vus et d'une complexit\u00e9 \u00e9norme touchant Kinetik Productions qui a pris des tournures insurmontables cette semaine nous nous voyons maintenant obliger de prendre une d\u00e9cision drastique. Sans rentrer dans les d\u00e9tails due \u00e0 la nature confidentielle de l'\u00e9v\u00e8nement,  nous faisons maintenant face \u00e0 une grave situation qui met en p\u00e9ril la continuit\u00e9 du Festival Kinetik. Apr\u00e8s avoir consult\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents experts et regard\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rentes options que nous avions, nous avons dus prendre la difficile d\u00e9cision de mettre un terme \u00e0 l'aventure Kinetik Productions et donc mettre en arr\u00eat d\u00e8s maintenant le Festival Kinetik 2014.\n\nPour ceux qui me connaissent personnellement vous savez que le Festival Kinetik \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 une grande part de ma ''vie'' pour les huit derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es et ce n'est pas sans regret et sans avoir regarder toutes les options avant de prendre cette difficile d\u00e9cision. Mais avec toutes les r\u00e9percutions actuelles et la confirmation que le festival ne pourrait avoir lieu sans r\u00e9percutions majeure nous avions pas d'autre choix que d'annuler l'\u00e9dition 2014 du festival. Nous sommes au courant de l'impact sur les visiteurs venant de loin pour le festival et pour tous les fans qui ne pourrons pas voir leurs groupes pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s, mais nous voulons avant tout nous assurer que nous sommes en position de pouvoir rembourser l'achat des billets du festival. N'\u00e9tant pas une grosse bo\u00eete de productions de musique commercial, notre organisme \u00e0 but non lucratif n'a que pour seul revenu la vente de billets du festival annuel. Nous esp\u00e9rons que vous comprendrez que ceci \u00e9tais le seul moyens de nous sortir de la situation pr\u00e9sente tout en assurant un remboursement dans les plus bref d\u00e9lais pour les visiteurs.\n\nLa situation qui a pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 cette annulation n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec la salle de spectacle de Toronto, les partenaires ou groupes de musiques qui depuis le d\u00e9but d\u00e9montre un support complet envers le festival. Nous sommes aussi actuellement en train de travailler avec des personnes ressources de Toronto pour voir les options pour que certains spectacles qui faisaient parti des tourn\u00e9es puissent quand m\u00eame avoir lieux. Plus d'informations sera publi\u00e9e d\u00e8s que des mises \u00e0 jour seront disponibles.\n\nLes remboursements d'achats de billets commencerons aujourd'hui, en ordre d\u00e9croissant (\u00e0 partir des ventes de ce week end) comme Paypal offre un remboursement direct pour les achats les plus r\u00e9cents. Une fois rendu aux transactions non couvertes par ce remboursement direct, nous allons vous contacter \u00e0 l'adresse courriel utilis\u00e9 originalement pour faire l'achat de vos billets. Nous allons publier des mises \u00e0 jour sur le groupe Facebook et la page web du festival pour vous tenir au courant des p\u00e9riodes d'achats ou nous allons en \u00eatre pour les remboursements. Assurez-vous de rapidement r\u00e9pondre lorsque vous recevrez un courriel de  ''sales@festival-kinetik.net'' et qu'il n'arrive pas dans vos courriel ind\u00e9sirables pour assurer un remboursement rapide.\n\nEncore une fois, ceci n'est vraiment pas comme nous l'avions envisag\u00e9 l'\u00e9dition 7.0 du festival et nous esp\u00e9rons que vous comprendrez que ceci \u00e9tais malheureusement notre unique et derni\u00e8re option apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 tous les options qui auraient pu \u00e9viter une pareille annulation.",

Doors are at 6pm for anyone coming for dinner or wanting a preferred seat. This one might sell out so make sure you book ahead!\n\nMORE PLEASE!\n\n***www.morepleasemusic.ca \n\nMore Please Just named one of top 10 anglo Canadian bands to watch for in 2014\n\n***http://quebec.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/02/10/artistes-anglophones-canadiens-a-surveiller_n_4760385.html\n\nScotty Mack, the creative inspiration behind the band More Please!, splits his time between guiding trips in the wilderness and playing music in cities. More Please! songs evoke the tension of a polarized Canadian experience, transporting you from gritty city life, through rolling countryside to the woods, and back again.\nMore Please! has evolved into a shared adventure amongst friends. Chris Norman, Nathan Doucet (Crosss, Mike O\u2019Neil) and Ian MacKay (Basia Bulat) first joined Scotty to create the band. \n\nAfter producer and touring artist David Pepe Celia recorded a demo of the band in his 1970\u2019s Mississauga bungalow, he joined More Please! and produced a full-length record at his home studio Organica and at Andy Magoffin's House of Miracles. The culmination of this effort is the debut More Please! album The Bounty, to be released in the spring of 2014. The diversity of the rhythms, the inspired arrangements, the balance between psychedelic folk, progressive rock and indie pop will take you on a sonic journey. \n\nMore Please! has found inspiration by collaborating live and in the studio with a wide range of musicians: Warren Spicer and Mathew Woodley (Plants and Animals), Joe Grass (Patrick Watson), Josh Toal (Katie Moore), Dani Daniel Oore (Gypsophelia), Bob Wiseman (Blue Rodeo), Leanne Zacharias (Christine Fellows, Hylozoists), Sarah Page (Barr Brothers), Bryden Baird (Fiest), Rebekah Higgs, Jeff Louch, Brooke Gray Harris and Terra Lightfoot among others.\n\nThe More Please! adventure does not end with the album; witnessing a live performance will let you experience their musical landscape first-hand.",

        "description": "\"An exciting and provocative play, an unforgettable evening of drama.\" \u2014NY Post.\n\n\"Stirring moments of impassioned rhetoric you feel as if you've watched a kind of human-scale wrestling with angels.\" \u2014San Francisco Examiner.\n\n\"A remarkable, intensely intimate meeting full of undisguised competitiveness, deep passion and potent reasoning THE MEETING is enthralling.\" \u2014Chicago Sun Times.\n\nFascinating and dramatically compelling, this eloquent play depicts a secret meeting of two of the most important men of modern times: Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Differing in their philosophies, but alike in their mutual respect, the two men debate their varying approaches to the same grave social problems, both prepared to die for their beliefs but neither aware of how soon their assassins' bullets would await them.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nThe action takes place in a suite high up in a Harlem hotel, where Malcolm X and his bodyguard, Rashad, rest before Malcolm's fateful appearance at the Audubon Ballroom. Malcolm has requested a secret meeting with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who is also in New York, and Dr. King has responded by trudging up the back stairs to Malcolm's suite.\n\nCautious at first, the two quickly fall into a spirited debate about their differing approaches to improving the lot of the black man in a predominantly white society\u2014Dr. King (the lamb) hoping to find racial harmony through love and peaceful resistance, while Malcolm (the lion) is reconciled to violence and revenge if blacks are to win out over oppression. But no matter how provocative and persuasive his arguments, Malcolm is unable to shake Dr. King's commitment and composure\u2014even when he defeats him in a bout of arm wrestling. As it happens, Malcolm's Chicago home had been fire bombed that morning and, as he prepares to leave, Dr. King gives him a present: a much loved doll that his daughter had asked him to give to the Malcolm's. The two men then arm wrestle again, this time to a draw, an act symbolic not only of their clash of wills but also of the conflicting beliefs which both honor in the other but will not accept for themselves, no matter how eloquent and powerful the arguments set forth.\n\nWORLD APPEAL & ACCOLADES:\n\nThe Meeting is intelligent theatre; and has toured to all fifty states and more than a dozen countries including South Africa, the Netherlands, The Virgin Islands, Nigeria, Scotland, United Kingdom, Brazil, Jordan and Austria. \n\nProfile Entertainment takes pride in bringing this culturally significant event to Toronto\u2019s myriad audiences.\n\nACCOLADES:\n\u2022\n8 NAACP IMAGE AWARDS including Best Play and Best Playwright\n\u2022\n6 New York Audelco Nominations\n\u2022\nA Louis B.

These personal essays are by turns funny, provocative, and intelligent, but all are moving and honest. \n\nThe fifth book in a series of books about the twenty-first-century family, \"A Family by Any Other Name\" follows \"How to Expect What You\u2019re Not Expecting,\" \"Somebody\u2019s Child,\" \"Nobody\u2019s Mother,\" and \"Nobody\u2019s Father,\" all essay collections that challenge readers to re-examine traditional definitions of family.\n\nMore about the book here: http://bit.ly/1msxBNo\n\nFor more information about this event, please call Ben McNally Books at (416) 366-8973 or email info@touchwoodeditions.com.\n\nwww.touchwoodeditions.com",

He is an internationally requested dj, whose productions and remixes are played by techno\u2019s most prominent names. Being a resident at Berlin\u2019s prime techno club Berghain since its opening in 2004 keeps him open-minded as both, dj and producer. His sound is constantly evolving without ever losing its vibrant, unique energy and the passion and heart he puts into his sets. His gigs are an audio-visual adventure where he is not only playing for the crowd but rather performing for and with them.\n\nEven before his move to Berlin in 2003, Len Faki had the experience of managing two highly acclaimed techno labels, Monoid and Feis. These early years of fruitful productivity provided the necessary groundwork for the next big steps in his career. Upon his arrival in Berlin, it didn\u00b4t take long until he became a resident-DJ in the newly opened Berghain - a match made in techno heaven and a monthly experience he wouldn\u00b4t want to miss for anything. The characteristic extra long DJ-sets in his \"living room\" inspire him to vary in tone and fully roll out his style to explore and further deepen his mastery of turning a DJ-set into a bona fide musical journey.",

Headlining the show will be Cleveland Heights\u2019 alternative hip-hop duo Deacon Burns and Kaya Rogue, known to the music industry as KOUNTERCLOCKWISE.  Local Toronto hip-hop artist Rakiem Smith will be making his Toronto debut for this show. \n\nKrip-Hop Nation:\n\nKrip-Hop Nation is a global movement of hip-hop artists with disabilities, founded by Leroy Moore. Since its inception, the movement has spread across the United States and beyond \u2013 from South Africa to New Zealand to Palestine. Krip-Hop is a community as well as style of music, an artistic space where youth with disabilities can speak out and speak back to the social structures that exclude people based on disability, race, sexuality, and a host of other marginalized identities. Krip-Hop Nation also strives to bring the talents of hip-hop artists with disabilities to the attention of a wider public, including media, educators, scholars, and journalists; and has developed a strong global online community to promote and disseminate the work of hip-hop by artists with disabilities.\n\nAbout the artists:\n\nLeroy F. Moore Jr.:\n\nYour host Leroy F. Moore Jr. is a Black writer, poet, hip-hop/music lover, community activist and feminist with a physical disability. Leroy is Co-founder and Community Relations Director of the Sins Invalid performance project, and is the creator of Krip-Hop Nation.  He is currently writing a Krip-Hop book.\n\nRob Da\u2019 Noize Temple is a music producer, songwriter, artists and keyboardist, and has been in the music industry for over 40 years. He has been playing keyboards since he was six years old and although he has Erbs Palsy, having just the use of one hand, he has never stopped trying to achieve his dreams.  As part of the group Conway & Temple, Rob was the first artist signed to Jive Records back in 1986 with the labels first single, \u201cLove Lights / You Can Lay Your Head On my Shoulder\u201d becoming a European hit.  He has continued producing music since 1980 as well as performing in live bands. Rob is currently music director, keyboardist and back-up DJ for the pioneers of Hip Hop, Rapper\u2019s Delight featuring Wonder Mike & Master Gee  and  has just completed music production on their newly released documentary, \u201cI Want My Name Back\u201d.\n\nKounterclockwise:\n\nDeacon Burns (MC, Producer, Songwriter, Musician & Engineer)\n\nIn 2007, as the group was courted by several indie & major labels; fate took a wrong turn when Deacon had a tragic accident \u2013 breaking 5 vertebrae, several ribs, collapsed both lungs and had a hairline neck fracture. He suffered a severe spinal cord injury that resulted in paralysis of both legs. As a true entertainer, Deacon decided that the show must go on no matter what. He spent his entire recovery time writing songs, accumulating an impressive catalogue of over 150. Deacon is a music aficionado whose influences vary from Nine Inch Nails to Ol\u2019 Dirty Bastard. He plays multiple instruments (guitar, bass, ASR10 and a MPC 2000XL), is a gifted producer & songwriter, and even directs & edits videos.\n\nKaya Rogue (Co-Producer, Co-Writer, Engineer, Singer & Musician)\n\nNew York City\u2019s Kaya Rogue also plays multiple instruments (guitar, bass, and keyboards), is a singer and assists Deacon in both music and video production. An entertaining part of the group\u2019s live show is when the audience dresses up as different characters. Their concerts have been labeled as \u201cvisual art\u201d. It\u2019s been a long time coming for Kounterclockwise to release their debut album, \u201cDaylight Savings Time.\u201d\n\nFor more information, visit: http://www.kounterclockwise.com/\n\nRakiem Smith:\n\nBio coming soon.\n\nAdmission:\n\n$10 General Admission\n$5 People with Disability, Student\n\nPurchase tickets for Saturday, April 12, 2014 @ 8pm: http://bit.ly/1kAgpEZ\t\n\nAdmission available at the door.\n\nAccessibility:\n\nTangled Art + Disability is committed to ensuring as accessible an environment as possible for all our programming.

        "description": "Hi Everyone,\n\nJust a reminder that Birthing From Within is coming to Toronto to do a training from May 7-9th.\n\n-Early birth and group pricing ends April 7th. \n-20 Contact Hours\n\nWhat is Birthing From Within?\n\nBirthing From Within offers an incredibly unique perspective on supporting parents that balances practical information (book knowledge) with instinctual knowing.\n\nAfter this training, you'll have deeply explored your personal relationship with childbirth and gained awareness of how you can separate your own experience with birth from those of your clients. In doing this, you are better equipped to mentor them as they discover what choices feel right for them. The emphasis here is that you're their guide, meant to help them find their own way, not a teacher who knows better and has more information than they do.\n\nDuring the training, you'll practice a variety of verbal coaching techniques to help you learn what a parent might need to work through a moment of fear, panic or trauma during birth. You'll explore the emotions that come up surrounding medical support and learn how one might approach the topic of epidurals and cesarean deliveries compassionately so as to prepare your clients for any path of birth that may unfold.\n\nAt the end of the training, the facilitator will actually do these practices with pregnant couples in front of you, so that you can see how what you're learning in the training translates to actual work with clients.\n\nThe training can be done on it's own to deepen your support skills or, following the training, you can register to certify as a Birthing From Within doula or childbirth educator.\n\nHere's the link! They only come here once every few years and are not planning another training here for the next 5 at least. This is not an \"I'll do it next time\" situation. If you're at all interested in this training, now is the time to do it!\n\nhttp://thenestingplace.ca/news_events.php\n\nWarmly,",

With the main Exhibition taking place May 10th and 11th 2014 at Toronto Reference Library, and a week\u2019s worth of events leading up to it, TCAF is expected to draw a crowd of 20,000 across all festival events, and will reach new heights as one of the most celebrated literary comics events in the world!\n\nFounded in 2003 in cooperation with Toronto\u2019s venerable comix enclave The Beguiling, TCAF seeks \u201cto promote the breadth and diversity of comics, and what is considered comics, as a legitimate medium of literary and artistic worth.\u201d By partnering with Presenting Sponsor Toronto Public Library, TCAF has achieved its goal of changing the North American comics landscape by creating an industry-leading event that is free, diverse, and accessible to existing readers of comics and new fans alike.\n\nPROGRAMS: \n\nTCAF KIDS DAY: Where are the next generation of comics and graphic novel readers coming from? TCAF KIDS DAY! TCAF Kids Day 2014 will take place at St. Paul\u2019s on Bloor, 227 Bloor St. E., on Saturday May 10th from 10am-5pm. TCAF Kids Day 2014 will feature young-reader oriented author presentations for audiences up to 200, as well as large author signings, interactive activities, and more! TCAF\u2019s first Kids Day was in 2012 at St Paul\u2019s on Bloor, and was visited by more than 1000 attendees! This will act as a compliment to TCAF's Kids Programming at Toronto Reference Library, Beeton Audtorium, on May 10th and 11th as part of the traditional TCAF program. \n\nCANADIAN READING SERIES: This year, TCAF has created a dedicated space to discover and enjoy the work of Canadian graphic novelists. Come to discover what the whole world already knows -- that Canada is creating some of the most unique and interesting graphic novels in the world! \n\nWORD BALLOON ACADEMY: On May 9th, TCAF will be offering a new stream of professional development programming by comics creators for comics creators and comics professionals. Share and build up your own knowledge base and skills! Maybe you\u2019ve figured out Twitter, maybe you want to do an inking demo with a specific kind of nib, maybe you\u2019ve got photocopying down to an art, maybe you\u2019ve got storytelling down to a science \u2014 This is the day for you! Look for information on registering for these programs this March.\n\nAnd More to come!",

We are constantly  bombarded by negative stories in the media in particular the embarrassing past year for Toronto and I saw this video http://youtu.be/Ib3Duz_6a9M that inspired my idea. I want everyone to put on their earphones and dance their  way to and from work / school this day.  (NOT DRIVERS OF VEHICLES).  Come on Toronto, join this event, like the post if you see it, share this event and in particular please invite everyone you know on Facebook, and Fri. Apr. 25 let's show the world how amazing Toronto is and have millions of us dancing to and from work / school all day.  I can't dance, I do this white guy kinda shuffle lol, so don't worry whether you can dance or not, it's about us coming together in a celebration of fun positive energy.  Who is with me? (Pedestrians obey your signals and drivers be extra careful this day.) I need your help to promote this so please click on the 'Invite' tab and click on everyone you know in Toronto to add them directly to this event.  Thanks!  #torontodancetowork",

They appeared for the first time at MUTEK in 2010 before teaming up for a 3 hour improv with MATHEW JONSON, during the 2012 edition. They have never played in Toronto, until now.\n\nThis tour marks a kind of denouement as they take an indefinite hiatus from this project to focus on solo pursuits and new opportunities. In a statement, the duo explained: \u201cWe feel that the time has come for us to explore new musical universes, one by one. We support each other fully in this and are excited about the musical adventures we have in front of us.\u201d\n\nMINILOGUE will fill these farewell appearances with their unbridled technological and musical prowess, performing a FOUR HOUR LIVE SET.\n\nEvent Supported by: alienInFlux, Box of Kittens\n\nVisuals by Artefact\nSound by alienInFlux\n\nTICKETING NOTES:\nPlease note that Super Earlybird tickets, Earlybird tickets and Advanced tickets are available while quantities last, and not necessarily until end time shown.\n\nPurchasing a Super Earlybird, Earlybird, or Advanced ticket enters the named ticket holder into a draw for a pair of weekend passes to the 15th anniversary of MUTEK in Montreal (EM 15 - http://em15.org/en).

Every major record company in the world decided to band together for the entire four years of FAF's existence to prevent us from making and releasing this album. If the average person were to be exposed to any part of one of the eight songs on the album, the shock of hearing something that isn't complete shit would be so great that they might cease listening to the genre known as popular music altogether. We have, however, won the battle against their tyrannical censorship of all things that don't suck, and so we are bringing the album to you at long last. Not only are you going to be able to get your hands on this musical oasis in a desert of garbage, but you can see the band play live as well with another band that is not shit, New Teeth.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFriday April 4th\r\nat The Garrison (1197 Dundas St W at Ossington)\r\n\r\nSOON AS FUCK \r\n\r\n$10 or $15 with a CD \r\n\r\nCHEAP AS FUCK \r\n\r\nNew Teeth \r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/newteethband\r\n&\r\nFAT AS FUCK\r\nwww.fatasfuck.ca\r\n\r\nOrder your god damn tickets through Eventbrite!:\r\nhttp://fatasfucktorontocdrelease.eventbrite.com/?aff=efbevent\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd because we love you and appreciate how long you had to wait for it, here's the first song on the album for free:\r\n\r\n(Johnny Doesn't Drink) Kraken (Anymore...)\r\nhttp://fatasfuck.bandcamp.com/",

        "description": "We know, we know... you're all thinking \"Toronto Beermile there's so much snow, nothing can pull us from this winter depression\" Well here you go!\n\nShake off the winter gloom and start prepairing for the second most talked about event in sports, 1st being the Summer Beermile. Saturday May 3rd at 7pm the Annual Spring Beermile will take place at the West Toronto Collegiate Institute! BE THERE.\n\nWhether or not you \"love running\", come and join us for the first Toronto Beermile of the year!\n\nGiven the time of the year its going to be a little nippy, but fret not the beer always keeps your warm.\n\nThis time honored tradition has been going on for centuries now. Whether your competing or cheering we want to see you there. Please invite any friends, family or loved ones to aid in the excitement.\n\nFor those who don't know what a beer mile is, its simple!\n\n1. Each competitor drinks four cans of beer and runs four laps on a track (Start - beer/lap, beer/lap, beer/lap, beer/lap - finish).\n\n2. Beer must be consumed before the lap is begun, within the transition area which is the 10 meter zone before the start/finish line on a 400m track.\n\n3. The race begins with the drinking of the first beer in the last meter of the transition zone to ensure the competitors run a complete mile (1609 meters).\n\n4. Competitors must drink canned beer and the cans should not be less than 355ml (the standard can volume) or 12oz (the imperial equivalent). Bottles may be substituted for cans as long as they are at least 12 oz (355 ml) in volume.\n\n5. No specialized cans or bottles may be used that give an advantage by allowing the beer to pour at a faster rate. ie \"super mega mouth cans\" or \"wide mouth bottles\" are prohibited.\n\n6. Beer cans must not be tampered with in any manner, ie. no shotgunning or puncturing of the can except for opening the can by the tab at the top. The same applies with bottles - no straws or other aids are allowed in order to aid in the speed of pouring.\n\n7. Beer must be a minimum of 5% alcohol by volume. Hard ciders and lemonades will not suffice. The beer must be a fermented alcoholic beverage brewed from malt and flavored with hops. For an abbreviated list of valid beers and exceptions, click here.\n\n8. Each beer can must not be opened until the competitor enters the transition zone on each lap.\n\n9. Competitors who vomit before they finish the race must complete one penalty lap at the end of the race (immediately after the completion of their 4th lap). Note: Vomiting more than once during the race still requires only one penalty lap at the end.\n\n10. Have as much fun as possible!\n\n\nFor any questions or regrets please let us know!",

        "description": "Bad Movie Night Toronto smashes its way into Clinton\u2019s this month with a pseudo double bill featuring THE AMAZING BULK and POOCHINSKI!\n\nYes, you can probably guess which oh so famous comic book character THE AMAZING BULK is ripping off, but instead of being a straight-up copycat, this flick gradually transforms into a much more bizarre cinematic experience involving a monocle-wearing mad scientist and a plot to blow up the moon. Plus, there\u2019s the \u201cspecial effects\u201d that absolutely *need* to be mentioned.  Shot entirely in front of a green screen, THE AMAZING BULK plays like the shoddiest clipart version of Sin City you done ever seen. The movie has the visual style of a cluttered Geocities webpage and even the Dancing Baby gif of the long off 1990s displays more realistic and attractive CGI animation than anything you\u2019ll witness here. Oogachaka, indeed! \n\nNow since THE AMAZING BULK is only 75 minutes long, we\u2019ll also be watching\u2026\n\nPOOCHINSKI \u2013 a failed ABC television pilot about a cop (played by Peter Boyle) who is killed in the line of duty, only to come back to life as a street-smart talking bulldog. Yup. Now while the premise itself is ridiculous, what really piles on the crazy is how this poor pilot desperately wants to be everything for everyone. So in a jam-packed 20 minutes, POOCHINSKI tries to provide exciting action, odd couple buddy comedy, a romantic subplot, the obligatory talking dog hijinks, *and* a serious conversation about the precious nature of life. Also, not too be outdone by THE AMAZING BULK\u2019s uber-cheapo fx, the animatronic bulldog puppet of POOCHINSKI is pretty horrid looking and rumoured to have cost a bunch of cash. Woof.  \n\n* * * * *\n\nAdmission is FREE.\nDoors open at 7:30 PM.\n19+ event.",

        "description": "\u2665\u2665\u2665 You are cordially invited to Toronto's QUEER SLOWDANCE - PROM Edition! \u2665\u2665\u2665\n\nWith a lending library of designated dancers for all you wallflowers, and a dancecard-booklet to set up dances in advance (should you choose to), Toronto Queer Slowdance has all slow songs, all night long! (Except for the occasional intermission when we play the fastest songs we can find!)\n\nIt's high school with a happy ending. Come and experience why slow is beautiful, and why love is not ironic.\n\nPS. Fabulous and inspired attire, while desired, is not required. But as this is our PROM EDITION and there will be a PHOTOGRAPHER on hand as well as a CHEESY BACKDROP of an exploding galaxy that you will WANT to have your picture taken in front of, and you will want to be in your charmingest and fanciest duds when it happens!\n\nFinally, you do not have to be queer to attend this party, but you must have an open mind, an open heart, and have open arms. Do keep in mind that the majority of folks attending are lesbian & gay, so if you are stridently straight, this may not be the most receptive community for you.\n\nWe are always looking for designated dancers for our evenings. If you are outgoing, warm, and willing to undertake the very serious duty and responsibility of inviting wallflowers out onto the dancefloor - if in fact, such a prospect gives you great joy - then please contact the organizers at inconsolablecat@hotmail.com.\n\nTo be alerted to \u2665\u2665\u2665 FUTURE EVENTS \u2665\u2665\u2665 in your area, please sign-up to our emailing list right here: http://eepurl.com/QHnpb  We will do our best not to spam you! We hate that too! Likely it will be one email a month letting you know what events are upcoming.\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nDovercourt house\n805 Dovercourt Rd. (1 block North of Bloor, 3 blks. west of Ossington)\nSaturday, April 12, 2014\nDoors at 9:30, Dance from 10 PM - 3 AM.\n$10 admission includes your Dancecard-booklet!\nRegretfully, the Dovercourt House is not wheelchair-accessible.\n19+\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\"Relive the prom without the angst.\" - the Canadian Press\n\n\"In an age where physical contact is a scarce commodity, an event that brings strangers safely together is long overdue.\" - The Montreal Gazette\n\n\"I really like hugging people, and this is like, a five-minute hug.\" - Telyn Kusalik, one of our guests\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\n\u2665 A NOTE ABOUT THE DANCE CARDS: The dancecards are these little booklets that contain a setlist of every song that will be played that evening. The idea is that during the course of the evening, you can \"book\" certain songs with certain people, and vice versa. So when your charming hosts announce a particular song, you can look on your dancecard and see who it is you're going to dance with next. There is a little space after every song where people can write their names. How filled your dancecard gets depends on you, of course. Ask someone to dance! Or give someone meaningful looks! Look for the Dancecard-Signing Station located somewhere on the premises, usually near a light, where small pencils are available. The dancecards also - thoughtfully - have lots of empty places where you can write down the names and numbers of charming people whom you may have danced with that night. Use of the dancecards, is, of course, optional, and completely up to you. Proceed at your comfort level.\n\n\u2665 A NOTE ABOUT THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT: The Rules essentially state that as someone coming to Queer Slowdance, you have the right to ask anyone you want to dance. But whoever it is you asked has the right to refuse your request, and not have to give any reason why. But wonderfully, you have this right as well. This is done because slowdancing with someone is rather an intimate sort of enterprise, and a minor commitment, and you should have the right to back out anytime you wish. Queer Slowdance is about consensual respect and enjoyment. Just because you may have danced with someone for most of the song, if at any point you are feeling unsafe or uncomfortable, you can simply walk away. If whoever it is persists in their attention, locate one of the organizers, and they will be ejected from the premises. And fucked-up. Anyone who refuses to comply by the rules will be fucked-up. Kidding! Kinda.\n\n\u2665 A NOTE ABOUT THE DESIGNATED DANCERS: On any particular night there will be a handful of our Designated Dancers available to dance with you for the first half of the evening - so arrive early! They will be wearing glowing items over their hearts, and these Designated Dancers are warm, charming, and safe people to ask to dance. Of course, the same Rules of Engagement apply, and they, as free agents, can decide for themselves who they want to dance with, and for how long, but in all likelihood, they would be very open to dancing with you. Please think of them as a warm taxi light in the middle of a blizzard; the cast of a lighthouse, when you are too far from shore and shrouded in fog; a glimmer of hope after a lifetime of desolation. Well, actually, that might be pushing it. Please think of them as a temporary safe harbour. They will also be looking for you, and asking you to dance, trying in their way to turn any wallflowers into perennials.\n\n\u2665 A NOTE ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY: We have received a number of emails and wall-posts about accessibility - or rather, the lack of it - at our current venue, the Dovercourt House. We understand, and it is an ongoing concern. We are not opposed to moving venues to an accessible one, but various places, for various reasons, didn\u2019t work out. When we finally came upon the Dovercourt House, which superficially resembles a school gym, has a working mirrorball, a sound system, lovely lighting, and a bar - it was perfect. We have, however, been following up on your suggestions for accessible venues, but there have been difficulties. Every venue is very particular, and finding a good match is hard. Additionally, we are based in Montreal. We come into Toronto every time to put the event on, and that doesn\u2019t leave much time to tour various venues, or to make face-to-face contact with the venue bookers. If you have a personal contact at the Revival, or the Garrison, we would appreciate an introduction. Thus far, they have not responded to our (in some cases, repeated) inquiries. For those who are interested in the particular accessibility challenges that the Dovercourt House presents - there are 12 steps going up the front to the \"main\" floor, with a handrail, and then another step at the doors. The bathrooms have stalls, but they are very small and difficult to manouever.\n\n\u2665 A NOTE ABOUT COMMON SCENTS: Because at this event folks will be in very close proximity to each other, pretty much hugging, we would like attendees to be mindful of what they smell like. Now, we don't want to stipulate that attendees must not wear scents, or use scented soaps or shampoos, or not smoke. One of the best thing about Queer Slowdance is that you can choose who you would like to dance with, and we are loathe to take choices away from attendees - but if you have a habit of spraying a cologne or perfume on before leaving the house, we would ask that you consider NOT doing so. Smell the way you smell. This does not mean not bathing. We heartily encourage bathing and wearing freshly laundered clothes. But the fact is, in this culture, we often try to cover up \"bad\" smells by pouring on the \"good\" ones. We would ask that you take as much consideration regarding what you SMELL like as what you LOOK like before you leave the house. (PS. We recognize that our providing breath mints and gum is totally hypocritical here). And actually, for some chemically injured/scent-sensitive folks, this is an issue of accessibility, so we ask you to be considerate. Thank you!\n\n\u2665 A NOTE ABOUT POLITELY DECLINING: So at this event, there is a high likelihood that you may be asked to dance by someone of the same, opposite, or indeterminate gender. We understand that people have preferences, irrespective of gender, regarding who they want to dance with. We urge you to be very polite if someone has asked you to dance but you do not want to dance with them. A simple \"No thank you,\" will suffice. You do not have to explain why. One incident that was related to us involved a young woman who was asked to dance by another, and she responded thusly: \"No, I'm straight.\" For reasons we hope are self-evident, this is a little rude. No explanation was required. We urge you, when declining, to be brief and polite. Please keep in mind that the person asking you to dance is taking a big emotional risk. You do not have to explain why you are declining. Indeed, we urge you not to.\n\n\u2665 A NOTE ABOUT HOMOPHOBIC ARTISTS: It was recently brought to our attention that certain artists, like Bon Jovi, Guns \u2018n Roses, Sting, Eminem, Ween, Public Enemy, The Pogues, The Kinks, Sex Pistols, Frank Zappa, Korn, Violent Femmes, or Chris Brown, are alleged to have made homophobic slurs or statements in the past, and/or have homophobic lyrics in their songs. In certain cases it\u2019s hard to be sure if the homophobia was deliberate, like in The Kink\u2019s \u201cLola\u201d which leaves things kinda mysterious. In other cases, like The Spice Girls\u2019 \u201c2 Become 1\u201d, heteronormativity is espoused, like in their lyric \u201cAny deal that we endeavour/boys and girls go good together\u201d. Though, to their credit, in recent years, a new version of that song has emerged, which has changed the lyrics to: \u201cOnce again when we endeavour, love will bring us back together\u201d which is more inclusive. This puts us in a bit of a quandry, as you can imagine, because it\u2019s hard to keep track of every homophobic artist and every homophobic song, and even more difficult to parse out the meaning behind every lyric. Additionally, this brings into question whether we necessarily need to attach the views of an individual artist or band to a particular song. What if the artist is homophobic, but the band is not, and the song has nothing to do with queerness? Should we enjoy the song? Here, at Queer Slowdance, after much agonizing, we\u2019ve decided to take on the possibly controversial policy of \u201cFuck It \u2013 it\u2019s a great song.\u201d We are going to play whatever song we like because it\u2019s a wonderful song and succeeds in bringing people closer together. We know that some of you might disagree with this, and we look forward to your angry emails, but we are also big believers in Ani DiFranco\u2019s truism: \u201cEvery tool is a weapon if you hold it right.\u201d And we believe that any song can be made beautiful if you\u2019re holding the right person in your arms.\n\n\u2665 A NOTE ABOUT SAFETY: Sometimes it happens that there is someone in the crowd who will make you feel unsafe or uncomfortable when dancing. This does not have to be an obvious thing, like leading with their groin, or grabbing your bum. It could just be a weird feeling. You are more than within your rights to stop the dance right there, and not have to explain. Overwhelmingly, our guests are courteous and polite and will comport themselves like gentlefolk, but every event that is open to the public may occasionally encounter someone who is, let's be honest, kinda creepy. While we encourage testing limits, when it infringes on someone's boundaries, that is when we draw the line. If something like this happens, do please let the organizer know. The organizer is the man in the stunning dress at the DJ Laptop. He is both your mom & dad tonight and a safe person to come to if something happens, and we will try to resolve it with everyone's safety in mind.\n\n\u2665 A NOTE ABOUT HELPING: We would love it if you would share our event on your Facebook page and invite your friends! You likely know hundreds of people we have never met, and in our attempts to bring slowdancing to everyone on the planet, we would really appreciate it if you would share the event. Thank you!\n\n\u2665 ANOTHER NOTE ABOUT SAFETY: The organizer reserves the right to ask anyone to leave for any reason which he does not have to divulge to anyone.\n\n\u2665 A NOTE ABOUT THE NOTES: Holy shit! Did you really read down this far? That's awesome. We always read all the minutiae & marginalia too.",

Women are crying out to connect once again to the sacred feminine, both around them and within their bodies.\n\nThere is a need deep within to validate their femininity in all its forms, to release the restraints, pain and guilt, and to step into the world free and joyful and connected to the powerful energies that are inherent in being a woman. In this predominantly masculine world, it is time to heal the feminine and to embrace, celebrate and release its beauty and gifts.\n\nThe Womb Blessing Training Workshop is a two-day certificated course with Miranda Gray which will:\n\n    connect you to the Womb Blessing energy through the \u2018Moon Mother\u2019 initiation\n    teach you to how to give the Womb Blessing attunement\n    share the spirituality behind the Womb Blessing meditation\n    explain when to give a Womb Blessing attunement and some of the effects of the Blessing\n    show a simple self-healing technique\n    teach you to give a supporting Womb Healing\n\nThe \u2018Moon Mother initiation'  given to you on the first day of the workshop is a gift of Divine Feminine healing energies, making you a channel for these vibrations and helping you to cleanse and clear your own patterns. You will learn a simple hands-on Womb Healing sequence to help women to gently heal their femininity and their womb energy centre or \u2018Sacred Grail\u2019.\n\nYou will also be taught how to give the Womb Blessing attunement to women. Each time a woman receives the Womb Blessing attunement, her healing and the connection to the sacred feminine energies within her deepens. She will also be able to access the energy for her own personal healing and development.\n\nThere will be plenty of time to practise.\n\nBeing a registered 'Moon Mother'\n\nAt the end of the course you will be a registered \u2018Moon-Mother\u2019 and be able to give Womb Healings and Womb Blessing initiations/ attunements. The course is certificated and there are accompanying notes.\n\nWorking with the Womb Blessing energies changes us and changes our lives. Being a \u2018Moon Mother\u2019 is a path for bringing the spiritual energies of the Divine Feminine into everyday life and connecting women in a single, loving, spiritual, and female family.\n\nEach Womb Blessing attunement is a powerful gift of healing and may be given as often as required. You may use the Womb Blessing as part of your healing therapies, as part of your spiritual path or simply as a way to help women. Womb Blessings can be offered at Full Moon or Red Tent groups, they can help women through transitions and changes in their lives, and they can be a way to celebrate and acknowledge first menses, marriage, motherhood, and menopause.\nWho can do the training workshop?\n\nThe two-day training workshop is open to women of all ages, with a womb or without, with a cycle or without, or with a natural cycle or a medically managed cycle. It is however not recommended to do the workshop if you are heavily pregnant.\nBooking\n\nThere are a limited number of spaces available. Please call or email Lana at 416-923-4325 or lkevic@gmail.com to register or for more information.\n\nPlease note that this workshop is taking place on the 3rd floor. If you have difficulties with stairs, please let us know.\n\nFor more on the Womb Blessing:\nhttp://wombblessing.com/",

CLICK HERE! https://cause2give.unxvision.com/P2PWeb/PublicParticipantPage.aspx?ParticipantIdView=20730&EventId=202&LanguageId=1 ***\n\nHello friends!\n\nI hope that you\u2019re well and surviving the deep freeze! (Except for those of you in the tropics...) I've gotta say, these days, I'm missing that prairie DRY cold!\n\nI'm hoping that I can count on your support for an amazing fundraising initiative I'm taking part in called Sleep Out, in support of Covenant House, here in Toronto.\n\nTHE CAUSE\n\nCovenant House is a shelter and social service organization that provides essential life-changing, and life-saving, services and supports to homeless youth. An individual plan is developed for each youth to get their life back on track. They must work, attend school or participate in a mental health day program and must set goals for themselves to achieve success. \n\nCovenant House's facilities also include a job training program, an in-house high school, a health care clinic, a mental health program, a crisis shelter, and a long-term residence in which youth can stay for up to a year as they gain skills, confidence, and independence.\n\nPretty great, no? \n\nIf you're interested in finding out more about Covenant House and the work they do: http://www.covenanthousetoronto.ca/  \n\nTHE EVENT\n\nOn April 10th, I will be spending the evening at the shelter, spending time with and getting to know the youth. Then, at 11:00 PM, I will be sleeping in a sleeping bag, on a piece of cardboard, on the streets of downtown Toronto to help raise money and awareness for this important cause.\n\nIt might not be Winnipeg, but it is NOT going to be warm!\n\nThis is the first year that the event is being held for young professionals. In the past, it has been held for executives and participants have included Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair, fashionista Jeanne Beker, and Arlene Dickinson from Dragons\u2019 Den.\n\nFor more details on the event: www.sleepoutnextgen.ca  \n\nI'm kicking off my fundraising campaign today, with the ambitious goal of raising $2,000 in the next month.\n\nThat's where you come in!! :)\n\nI'm hoping that I can count on my friends and family to help me reach my goal. After all, who is more likely to want to send me out to sleep in the cold than my nearest and dearest?\n\nI should also mention that the return on investment your donation is astronomical: Over 95% of your donation goes directly to supporting Covenant House's youth services.\n\nGiven that the industry standard for fundraising events is that you've got to spend about $0.60 to raise $1, this is very impressive.\n\nSo please, DONATE NOW: https://cause2give.unxvision.com/P2PWeb/Secure/Donate.aspx?p=20730&EventId=202&LanguageId=1 \n\nAlso, here is my participant page: https://cause2give.unxvision.com/P2PWeb/PublicParticipantPage.aspx?ParticipantIdView=20730&EventId=202&LanguageId=1 \n\nThanks so much, and I really appreciate your support!\n\nEvery donation counts!\n\nLove and warmth,\nBrandy\n\nP.S.

Since it doesn\u2019t look like the city is warming up any time to soon, you might as well get jump started on that Spring Cleaning \u2013 starting with your old, well-loved iPod! \n\nMarch is Music Therapy Month and we\u2019re on the hunt for old iPods in tip top shape. A couple of years ago, Vancouver musician Dominique Fricot partnered with Music Heals to start an iPod Pharmacy. They collected previously loved iPods to be repurposed in Music Therapy programs in Vancouver. This year, he\u2019s brought this to initiative to Toronto for the month of March and I am seeking your help to support this project.\n \nWHY? I was first introduced to Music Therapy when I began working in group homes for adults with intellectual disabilities over 10 years ago and I\u2019ve been a huge advocate ever since. I knew the right song could help get you through a break up but I had no idea the truly therapeutic power music had until I saw it first-hand. \n\nOn board with this idea? I thought so. Here\u2019s how you can help \u2013 so easy:\n\nDONATE your iPod. Dropboxes can be found at Vortex Records at Yonge and Eg or The 12th Fret on the Danforth (addresses above). \n          BUT ERIN, those locations are kinda out of the way for me. No problem! I\u2019m happy to come to you! Send me a message, we\u2019ll meet up and exchange your iPod for my good company \u2013 win/win!!\n\n           BUT ERIN, even though I totally love this idea, I actually use my iPod. That\u2019s cool, so do I! I still need one more thing\u2026 \n\nPlease SPREAD THE WORD! Invite your friends to join this event, odds are at least a few of them have an old iPod lying around. I tell people, you tell people, they tell people\u2026 you know how this works.\n\nFor more information about Music Therapy and Music Heals visit their website at www.musicheals.ca. If you have any questions about the iPod Pharmacy please contact info@dominiquefricot.com.\n\nLet\u2019s show Vancouver how Toronto gets things done!",
