Creado con el objetivo de promover los valores democr\u00e1ticos entre la juventud del Hemisferio, mediante un ejercicio de simulaci\u00f3n de la aut\u00e9ntica Asamblea General de la OEA. Este ejercicio familiariza a estudiantes, profesores e instituciones acad\u00e9micas con la labor de la Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Americanos y con sus Estados Miembros, as\u00ed como, con el papel de la Organizaci\u00f3n como el principal foro pol\u00edtico del Hemisferio.\n \n \nEl MOEA es un ejercicio de simulaci\u00f3n de las deliberaciones del Consejo Permanente de la OEA y de los per\u00edodos ordinarios de sesiones anuales de su Asamblea General, en el cual los estudiantes representan a los diplom\u00e1ticos de los Estados Miembros de la OEA donde debaten resoluciones sobre los temas actuales de la Agenda Interamericana.\n \n \nEstos Modelos promueven el desarrollo de liderazgo en los j\u00f3venes, as\u00ed como habilidades de negociaci\u00f3n, trabajo en equipo y resoluci\u00f3n de conflictos. Promueven un s\u00f3lido sentido de compromiso y liderazgo, as\u00ed como un compromiso con los principios de honestidad, igualdad, respeto y responsabilidad en los participantes, quienes deber\u00e1n adherirse a estos principios en todas las actividades del MOEA, y promover una cultura de integridad y respeto por la diversidad.\n \n \nEl Programa MOEA busca involucrar el mayor n\u00famero de estudiantes, mediante la organizaci\u00f3n de Modelos en cualquiera de los Estados Miembros de la OEA. Cada a\u00f1o aproximadamente 1500 estudiantes y m\u00e1s de 100 docentes del Hemisferio participan en estos Modelos. El IDDA organiza el MOEA para universidades, colegios secundarios y pasantes de la OEA. Este \u00faltimo proyecto es una actividad oficial del Programa de Pasant\u00edas de la OEA.  Con el objetivo de que j\u00f3venes universitarios y profesionales puedan trabajar dentro de los campos de estudio de la Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Americanos.\n \n \nAdicionalmente, a fin de preparar a sus estudiantes para participar en estos Modelos, varias universidades en el Hemisferio han desarrollado cursos que tienen como base el MOEA. Estos cursos tratan temas relacionados con la Agenda Interamericana, Relaciones Multilaterales e Internacionales, Diplomacia, Instituciones Internacionales, entre otros.\n \n \nQueremos Anunciar que FUNJADEM, Dirigida por j\u00f3venes de diferentes Universidades y Colegios, participar\u00e1 en el Modelo de la Asamblea General de la Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Americanos (MOEA) que este a\u00f1o se llevar\u00e1 a cabo en la misma sede de la OEA en la ciudad de Washington, DC, del 25 al 29 marzo en las aut\u00e9nticas salas de reuniones utilizadas por los representantes de los estados miembros y en las instalaciones del Hotel Fairmont de 5 estrellas.  \n \n \nComo objetivo principal, nuestros j\u00f3venes tendr\u00e1n que abordar las problem\u00e1ticas globales en un contexto del mundo real, esta ser\u00e1 la misi\u00f3n encomendada para los j\u00f3venes de diferentes lugares de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana que estar\u00e1n siendo seleccionados en los pr\u00f3ximos d\u00edas con la finalidad de viajar y participar  con FUNJADEM, en el Modelo de la Organizaci\u00f3n de los Estados Americanos (MOEA-2014).\n \n \nQueremos recordar que el MOEA es un esfuerzo de colaboraci\u00f3n entre la Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Americanos y el Instituto para el Di\u00e1logo Diplom\u00e1tica en las Am\u00e9ricas (IDDA), que es una entidad legalmente constituida, con el estado como una organizaci\u00f3n de la sociedad civil en la OEA, el MOEA y el apoyo activo de la Oficina del Secretario General Adjunto de la OEA y ha sido aprobado mediante una Resoluci\u00f3n de la propia Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Americanos. Esta colaboraci\u00f3n \u00fanica permite a los estudiantes un acceso sin precedentes a la OEA y sus misiones de los Estados miembros. Las ceremonias de apertura y clausura se celebrar\u00e1n en el Sal\u00f3n de las Am\u00e9ricas en la sede de la OEA en Washington, DC; estas sesiones son atendidas por los embajadores y el Secretario General de la Organizaci\u00f3n de los Estados Americanos.\n \n \nLas sesiones del Comit\u00e9 se celebrar\u00e1n en el Fairmont Hotel cerca de Georgetown.

Go full-bore, no looking back, steadfast in the mission.\n\nPhase 2 - One million or more of the assembled 10 million must be prepared to stay in D.C. as long as it takes to see Obama, Biden, Reid, McConnell, Boehner, Pelosi, and Attorney General Holder removed from office. The senior republican in the US House of Representatives will become Speaker of the House and the US House of Representatives will elect a temporary President and Vice President of the United States. The U.S. Senate will take action to elect a new majority and minority leader.\nAs required, the U.S. Congress will execute appropriate legislation to convene new elections or U.S. States will appoint replacements for positions vacated consistent with established constitutional requirements.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Those with the principles of a West, Cruz, Dr. Ben Carson, Lee, DeMint, Paul, Gov Walker, Sessions, Gowdy, Jordan, will comprise a tribunal and assume positions of authority to convene investigations, recommend appropriate charges against politicians and government employees to the new U.S. Attorney General appointed by the new President.\n\n*All actions in Phase 2 & 3 will be consistent with the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDate of Operation: \u201cOPERATION AMERICAN SPRING \u2013 Beginning Of Tyranny Housecleaning, May 16, 2014, completion to be determined\n\nWe are past the point of no return, thus must move forward with an effort to save our nation, as there is no other choice. We are asking, pleading with you, and any others that have resources, national voices, email lists, blogs, FB, Twitter, to call for a non-violent American Spring May 16 2014 in Washington D.C. We must appeal to ten million and more American patriots to come and stay in Washington, D.C. to stop the White House and Congress from total destruction of the United States. It\u2019s now or never. God help us.\n\n.....the law of nature rules. A fluffy, cuddly lamb gets eaten by a mean old wolf is not an illegal or immoral event...the law of nature. When some greedy, self-serving occupant of the White House or Congress, or elements outside America, is threatening our existence, our freedom, our liberty, our Constitution, our life resources, our America, then we fight back to destroy the threat and there is nothing immoral or illegal about it. When the government becomes lawless, then \"we the people\" no longer are obligated to follow the government......there is no law when government picks and chooses for political purposes or personal agenda. At this time the government is performing as a lawless entity......\n\nA duck cannot be turned into a fox; an elephant cannot be turned into a flea; the laws of nature will not permit.\nLikewise, a nation ordained and principled by the laws of nature, sovereign, free, with liberty for all cannot naturally become a nation guided by royalty, decrees, tyranny, elitist, self-serving criminals. The former has proven desirable, the latter has proven human pain.\n\u201cWe can become a nation guided by royalty IF \"we the people\" beguiled by the government in surrender to our lusts for that which we have not earned --for what is not natural --if we have become intoxicated by unbroken success\" as Lincoln proclaimed in March 30 ,1863 call for fasting, humiliation, and prayer--we can very easily heap to ourselves leaders, and with itching ears, be turned from the Truth to become enslaved by the LIE.\u201d\nThe United States of America (elephant) while embracing the \"LIE\" is teetering on the abyss of becoming a sniveling, blood sucking, undesirable nation (flea).\n\nOPERATION AMERICAN SPRING will be a gigantic step in removing the flea infestation that is sucking the blood out of America.\n\nWe see no reasonable, hopeful sign that indicates there are honorable, loyal, mature, critical thinking, experienced people in government that understands the chaos about to rain down on America, nor do they care....our only hope is that \"we the people\" call, organize, and draw a few million patriots to stay in D.C. for an \"American Spring\". It would be the catalyst to draw the line and bring to a conclusion a decision on the out of control government, one way or the other. America will rise up or surrender.........for me, I only go to my knees in the presence of God Almighty...........my knees will not touch the surface as a result of some piss ant occupant of the White House or a corrupt legislator, or outside element...I will fall to my death standing if necessary.\n\nhttp://patriotsforamerica.ning.com/forum/topics/purging-senior-military-officers-ncos-martial-law-in-the-not?xg_source=activity\n\nhttp://patriotsforamerica.ning.com/forum/topics/any-doubt-an-american-spring-is-needed\n\nhttp://patriotsforamerica.ning.com/forum/topics/the-uber-presidency-by-general-paul-vallely\n\nThere is not much time and the only planning necessary is to select a starting date, which we have done, and then show up in Washington, D.C. on that date, and plan to stay for the duration. The goal is restoring the US Constitution as the law of the land, removing the lawless leadership. Will this be a cake-walk? No, it will be painful, and some people may die because the government will not be non-violent; some of us will end up in a cell, and some may be injured. If that\u2019s what it will take to save our nation, do we have any choice? Freedom loving Americans will say there is no choice, we must begin the second American Revolution. Not with guns, but with millions of Americans demanding a return to constitutional government and the resignation of Obama, Biden, Reid, McConnell, Boehner, Pelosi, and Holder as a start...then the constitutional restoration process can begin. An AMERICAN SPRING can be avoided only if the above mentioned officials resign.\n\nWill our national patriot leaders step forward and declare, \u201csend me\u201d, I\u2019ll lead? There are millions of veterans and patriots ready to follow and have said \u201cI will go\u201d.\n\nI urge all organizations, groups, particularly veterans and military retirees begin planning to visit Washington, D.C beginning May 16, 2014. Keep tuned to Constitutional Emergency/Patriots for America www.patriotsforamerica.ning.com for updates and guidance.\n\nPlease bathe this effort in prayer as there is no personal agenda or gain save liberty, freedom, and restoration of constitutional government for \"we the people\".\n\nHarry Riley, COL, USA, Ret",

Join with us to \"STOP THE GANG OF EIGHT BEFORE THEY SEAL AMERICA'S FATE!\"  \n\n\nFREE Bus transportation being organized in many states.\nPlease click the 'See more' to view all the event details.\n\nShare this event: https://www.facebook.com/events/173448449498609\n\nLead Event Organizer: Leah Durant\n\nSTATEMENT: We believe it is time that members of Congress act to preserve economic opportunity for American workers - and pass immigration legislation that protects and supports the nearly 22 million American citizens who do not have jobs, or cannot find adequate employment to support their families. Economists report that labor participation in the U.S. is at its lowest rate in over 30 years. Despite sluggish economic conditions, some in Congress have put forth immigration proposals to increase legal immigration levels by 50% and provide amnesty to over 11 million people who have entered the country illegally. We stand against these proposals, as they will result in adding millions more to the U.S. labor force, putting millions of American citizens out of work.\n\nMISSION: We are assembling a coalition of like minded groups and individuals to help to stop Congress' amnesty push. Join the Black American Leadership Alliance and other concerned American citizens for our march on Monday, July 15, 2013 at 9:30 a.m. at Freedom Plaza as we demand that our leaders reject amnesty, and pass immigration policies that put all unemployed Americans citizens back to work.\n\nYou can find more info here: http://dcmarchforjobs.com/\nWe will be adding much more info on the website over the next few days.\n\nYou can also like/share our FB page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/DC-March-For-Jobs-Join-A-Bus/383712311734554\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored in part by:  http://teapartycommunity.com \n\nConfirmed Main Event Speakers:\nSenator Ted Cruz\nCol.

        "description": "Excision 2014 tour dates announced and the return of The Executioner.\n\nGet tickets for Washington DC @ http://smarturl.it/XMar22Tickets\n\nThere is truly no sleep for the wicked, as Canadian Dubstep pioneer Excision announces his massive 2014 Tour. Starting this January Excision will hit the road only weeks after wrapping the final string of Destroid live shows for 2013. \n\nEmbracing an unyielding pursuit to push the boundaries of bass music, Excision is continually creating and re-imagining innovative uses of cutting edge technology to impact his fans, as well as the EDM community at large. This 2014 Tour will prove to be his most extensive and most immersive tour experience to date. With an already phenomenal level of production at his disposal, you better believe he has gone even further. He is stepping things up to a whole new level and bringing a monstrous 150,000 watts of sound, which is capable of delivering insanely loud yet crystal clear audio to blast dance floors with room shaking bass in a way that bass music is ultimately designed to be felt as well as heard.\n\nThe 2014 tour also marks the return of the 28 foot wide, 15 foot tall mammoth video and lighting installation known as The Executioner. This custom crafted stage production was specifically designed for Excisions 3D video mapped visual sequences as he DJ's both music and video live on stage. The Executioner is fully recharged and returning as Excision\u2019s on-stage bass bunker, complete with brand new 3D visual animations displayed across its 420 square feet of surface area. This technological audio video monstrosity is equipped with various sliding panels and pneumatics to hide lazers, fog machines, an extensively upgraded lighting system and more than a few surprises yet to be revealed.\n\n\nDirtyphonics\n-\nDirtyphonics, the fabulous french DJ team joins with Excision for his 2014 tour. Bringing their signature style of genre bending madness from DNB, Electro House and everything in between, don't miss a second of their electrifying sets as they set the world on fire!\n\n\n\n\nIll.Gates \n-\nIll.Gates is a Toronto-based composer, performer and educator. Over the past 16 years, he has established a global fanbase and a reputation as one of the most dynamic electronic music artists around. He regularly tours across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Gates has headlined at such festivals as Burning Man, Shambala, the World Electronic Music Festival and the New Orleans Jazz Festival. His first full-length release, Autopirate (Muti Music, 2008) charted and continues to sell strongly. His upcoming triple album The ill.Methodology and accompanying online course are highly anticipated. Gates was recently selected as one of the Next 100 by URB Magazine.\n\nMany of his contemporaries cite ill.Gates as a key artistic influence and inspiration in their music. While on tour, Gates frequently teaches workshops to grateful and attentive audiences, in which he shares his highly effective approach to producing quality finished music as well as insights into the mentality and strategies necessary to succeed in the music business.",

        "description": "The following is copied from the Operation \u201cAmerican Spring\u201d set for May 16, 2014: Target Washington, D.C. FB Event Page as the mission...\n\nRestoration of Constitutional government, rule of law, freedom, liberty \u201cof the people, for the people, by the people\u201d from despotic and tyrannical federal leadership.\n\nAssumptions:\n\nMillions of Americans will participate.\n\nAmerican veterans and patriots are energized to end the tyranny, lawlessness, and shredding of the US Constitution.\n\nGovernment is not the target, it is sound; corrupt and criminal leadership must be removed.\n\nThose in power will not hesitate to use force against unarmed patriots exercising their constitutional rights.\n\nPatriots may be killed, wounded, incarcerated.\n\nThere is no hope given today\u2019s technology of secrecy for the effort nor do we want it secret.\n\nConcept of Operations:\n\nPhase 1 \u2013 Field millions, as many as ten million, patriots who will assemble in a non-violent, physically unarmed (Spiritually/Constitutionally armed), display of unswerving loyalty to the US Constitution and against the incumbent government leadership, in Washington, D.C., with the mission to bring down the existing leadership. Go full-bore, no looking back, steadfast in the mission.\n\nPhase 2 \u2013 One million or more of the assembled 10 million must be prepared to stay in D.C. as long as it takes to see Obama, Biden, Reid, McConnell, Boehner, Pelosi, and Attorney General Holder removed from office. The senior republican in the US House of Representatives will become Speaker of the House and the US House of Representatives will elect a temporary President and Vice President of the United States. The U.S. Senate will take action to elect a new majority and minority leader.\n\nAs required, the U.S. Congress will execute appropriate legislation to convene new elections or U.S. States will appoint replacements for positions vacated consistent with established constitutional requirements.\n\nPhase 3* \u2013 Those with the principles of a West, Cruz, Lee, DeMint, Paul, Gov Walker, Sessions, Gowdy, Jordan, Issa, will comprise a tribunal and assume positions of authority to convene investigations, recommend appropriate charges against politicians and government employees to the new U.S. Attorney General appointed by the new President.\n\n*All actions in Phase 2 & 3 will be consistent with the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDate of Operation: \u201cOPERATION AMERICAN SPRING \u2013 Beginning Of Tyranny Housecleaning, May 16, 2014, completion to be determined.\n\nWe are past the point of no return, thus must move forward with an effort to save our nation, as there is no other choice. We are asking, pleading with you, and any others that have resources, national voices, email lists, blogs, FB, Twitter, to call for a non-violent American Spring on May 16, 2014 in Washington D.C. We must appeal to ten million and more American patriots to come and stay in Washington, D.C. to stop the White House and Congress from total destruction of the United States. It\u2019s now or never. God help us.\n\nThe law of nature rules. A fluffy, cuddly lamb gets eaten by a mean old wolf is not an illegal or immoral event\u2026the law of nature. When some greedy, self-serving occupant of the White House or Congress, or elements outside America, is threatening our existence, our freedom, our liberty, our Constitution, our life resources, our America, then we fight back to destroy the threat and there is nothing immoral or illegal about it. When the government becomes lawless, then \u201cwe the people\u201d no longer are obligated to follow the government \u2026 there is no law when government picks and chooses for political purposes or personal agenda. At this time the government is performing as a lawless entity\u2026\u2026\n\nA duck cannot be turned into a fox; an elephant cannot be turned into a flea; the laws of nature will not permit.\n\nLikewise, a nation ordained and principled by the laws of nature, sovereign, free, with liberty for all cannot naturally become a nation guided by royalty, decrees, tyranny, elitist, self-serving criminals. The former has proven desirable, the latter has proven human pain.\n\n\u201cWe can become a nation guided by royalty IF \u201cwe the people\u201d beguiled by the government in surrender to our lusts for that which we have not earned \u2013for what is not natural \u2013if we have become intoxicated by unbroken success\u201d as Lincoln proclaimed in March 30, 1863 call for fasting, humiliation, and prayer\u2013we can very easily heap to ourselves leaders, and with itching ears, be turned from the Truth to become enslaved by the LIE.\u201d\n\nThe United States of America (elephant) while embracing the \u201cLIE\u201d is teetering on the abyss of becoming a sniveling, blood sucking, undesirable nation (flea).\n\nOPERATION AMERICAN SPRING will be a gigantic step in removing the flea infestation that is sucking the blood out of America.\n\nWe see no reasonable, hopeful sign that indicates there are honorable, loyal, mature, critical thinking, experienced people in government that understands the chaos about to rain down on America, nor do they care\u2026.our only hope is that \u201cwe the people\u201d call, organize, and draw a few million patriots to stay in D.C. for an \u201cAmerican Spring\u201d. It would be the catalyst to draw the line and bring to a conclusion a decision on the out of control government, one way or the other. America will rise up or surrender \u2026 for me, I only go to my knees in the presence of God Almighty \u2026 my knees will not touch the surface as a result of some piss ant occupant of the White House or a corrupt legislator, or outside element \u2026 I will fall to my death standing if necessary.\n\nThere is not much time and the only planning necessary is to select a starting date, which we will do soon, and then show up in Washington, D.C. on that date, and plan to stay for the duration. The goal is restoring the US Constitution as the law of the land, removing the lawless leadership. Will this be a cake-walk? No, it will be painful, and some people may die because the government will not be non-violent; some of us will end up in a cell, and some may be injured. If that\u2019s what it will take to save our nation, do we have any choice? Freedom loving Americans will say there is no choice, we must begin the second American Revolution. Not with guns, but with millions of Americans demanding a return to constitutional government and the resignation of Obama, Biden, Reid, McConnell, Boehner, Pelosi and Holder as a start \u2026 then the constitutional restoration process can begin. An AMERICAN SPRING can be avoided only if the above mentioned officials resign.\n\nWill our national patriot leaders step forward and declare, \u201csend me\u201d, I\u2019ll lead? There are millions of veterans and patriots ready to follow and have said \u201cI will go\u201d.\n\nI urge all organizations, groups, particularly veterans and military retirees begin planning to visit Washington, D.C beginning May 16, 2014. Keep tuned to Constitutional Emergency/Patriots for America www.patriotsforamerica.ning.com for updates and guidance.\n\n'INVITE' and BRING EVERYBODY, to Operation \"American Spring\" who believes in Saving Our Constitution, Our free and sovereign STATES and The Republic by restoring the Rule of our Ninth and Tenth Amendment Supreme Laws of The Land, which limit them to only the eighteen powers and spending granted them as itemized under Article I Section 8 of OUR Constitution, UPON our elected and wannabe elected Republican and Democrat enemies of OUR Bill of Rights. Bring our Rights, wages and salaries back home to our States and the people, which have been incrementally usurped by our elected Republican and Democrat despots since the 1913 Trifecta of Tyranny and Treason.\n\nPlease bathe this effort in prayer as there is no personal agenda or gain save liberty, freedom, and restoration of constitutional government for \u201cwe the people\u201d.\n\nThere are several organizations, in addition to this fb Event, organizing Operation \"American Spring\".\n\nRELATED COLUMNS:\n\nhttp://patriotsforamerica.ning.com/forum/topics/purging-senior-military-officers-ncos-martial-law-in-the-not?xg_source=activity\n\nhttp://patriotsforamerica.ning.com/forum/topics/any-doubt-an-americ\u2026\n\nhttp://patriotsforamerica.ning.com/forum/topics/the-uber-presidency\u2026",

If you can't hide it, come up with a clever answer as to why you're carrying a pillow around (wanted to take a nap while out, it's the chic thing to do and that's why everyone else here is doing it, etc.)\n\n+ Wait until the signal to begin (you'll know when we start).\n\n+ The event is free and appropriate for all ages. BUT...\n\n+ Please swing pillows lightly! Of all events we ever have, this one has the most children involved, so please be mindful who you're swinging at!\n\n+ It is recommended that children play outside the main pillow crowd.\n\n+ Do not swing at people without pillows or with cameras. \n\n+ Remove glasses beforehand! \n\n+ We encourage participants to leave down pillows at home. The less that pillows burst, the easier the clean up.\n\nWe're very excited, as this is our 6th year sponsoring this yearly pillow fight, and it has grown into the thousands!

In this 8th grade school trip, I will have the chance to see the Washington Memorial, along with the WWII and the Lincoln Memorials. Also, I\u2019ll fly in a plane for my first time EVER, and stay in a quality New York hotel. On top of that, I\u2019ll get to see a Broadway Show, the sights and sounds of New York, and even the Statue of Liberty!!! WOW! So excited!! This trip will take place the week after school gets out in June.\n\n\tHowever, I cannot do this alone. The total cost for the trip comes to $2,500. That\u2019s why my family and I are starting a fundraiser. We need to pay $150 a month, with the remainder due in March, so the money has to come in soon. If you live close by, I am willing to work for you to get the money. However, if you live farther away, like in Chico, then please donate what you can.  All donations will go directly to funding this spectacular opportunity.\n\nSo, remember,\n\nDON\u2019T BE A DORK,\nHELP JEFF TO NEW YORK!\n\n(and D.C.)\n \nCheers!\n-Jeffrey Sanchez",

WE AM SO PROUD OF ALL OF YOU! \n\nhttp://www.naaij.org/2014/03/01/march-against-government-corruption-media-from-around-the-world/\n\nWe look forward to the next event. Please post all your pictures and videos in this event as well as our facebook pages. Please chat in this event and continue to post. \n\nI hope everyone is up for round 2. There are many world protests happening on May 1, 2014. So I think we should join them all. Let us make it our goal on May 1, 2014 to get out and protest once again to help wake up the masses. At this point that is what the protests are doing in many places. Getting us out in the public and the public asking questions so we can educate them. It shows them not to be afraid to get out and protest. With each protest our numbers are growing. Once we have the numbers on our side, the change we seek will follow. \n\nOnce again the focus will be on world wide government corruption. Our goal is to wake up and educate the masses with this protest. Be peaceful and Loud! \n\nOnce again let us unite all groups for this event. Every one is welcome.\n\nTHIS TIME IT IS A 4 DAY EVENT TO REALLY WAKE UP THE MASSES. NOT EVERYONE CAN BE THERE ALL FOUR DAYS BUT PLEASE COME OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DURING THE 4 DAY EVENT!\n\n\nPeace and respect to everyone.",

        "description": "Please join us Friday, Dec 5th for one of DC's Greatest New Traditions...  \n\nThe 3nd Annual DC Krampusnacht!\n\nWith the holidays now upon us, we're all familiar w/ the story of Santa Claus. But according to ancient lore, St. Nicholas actually had several attendants, one of which was the horned satyr Krampus. Whereas St. Nick would reward good little girls & boys, Krampus would punish the bad kids. For 'truly' bad children, he'd even carry them off to later be devoured as his X-mas dinner!  \n\nTraditionally, Kampsuslauf takes place on Dec 5th (day before St. Nicholas Day). Celebratory revelers parade through the night, carousing their way through the streets & warn attendant children to be nice. \n\nIn a city known for its cultural diversity & multinational intrigue, this year we're proud to host the 3rd Annual Kampuslauf on H Street. With a schedule of events that run throughout the evening, Kampusnacht offers a little something for everyone - perfect for families & revelers alike!  \n\n\n- For a more detailed history see Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus \n- For an idea as to the Krampuslauf Tradition see: www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLnl5ZWG4tg \n\nAll parties are welcome to join in the fun! Full or partial participation is DEEPLY encouraged.  For the parade, any reasonable attempt for authentic costumes (professional or amateur) shall be openly welcome.\n\n To join the parade, costumes are required - join our group to participate! https://www.facebook.com/groups/krampusnachtdc/\n\nAll efforts go to benefit 'Santa's Cause DC' (https://www.facebook.com/SantasCauseDc): a special project for \"Family Matters of Washington, DC\" - striving to enhance the lives of foster children throughout the DC area, they provide a program for personalized gifts both during the December holidays (delivered by Santa himself) as well as on birthdays. In addition, they provide needed supplies for the entire school year. We will be accepting unwrapped toys & monetary donations to benefit this most worthy cause. \n\nSo bring your family or friends & kick off the holidays with a fun filled evening for all! No Doubt, THIS is a night you won't want to miss!",

        "description": "Are you ready for a one of a kind shoot???!! Mika Lovely is coming by and we are going to be shooting the most creative and amazing genre ever. Fetish!!!\n\nMika has been shooting fetish content for years and we are so lucky to be shooting her. She has shot latex, bondage/shibari/kinbaku, domme/sub scenarios. She is packing her suitcase with so many fetish outfits and accessories the TSA may hold her for questioning when she lands in dc. lol\n\n\nSo lets get to the fun.\n\nDownstairs Area\u2026 a living room with a pair of couches and chairs with a hanging back drop as needed/desired. We also have a black dungeon looking rack to maybe tie Mika to through out the workshop lol.  We have a few bare walls we may shoot on also. The goal of this workshop is to show how easy it is to shoot at home with minimal lights and gear. Studios are great when you need a certain look but you would be surprised what you can do at home.\n\n\n\nOkay\u2026 so now for the details\u2026\n\nWe will be shooting Mika in three different sets with each photographer having roughly 8-12 minutes to shoot with her in each set. Each set being around 45-50 mins. \n\nFirst set\u2026 \"Mika in Latex\" will be our first awesome start. Mika has a huge selection of latex outfit and we will be shooting her on our black or white backdrop or one of the Solid Walls we have with some high key lighting.\n\n\n\nSecond set\u2026 \"Mika in Nylons\" Mika has one of the largest collection of Nylons & Stockings i have seen and she will have them for us to shoot. \"Nothing but Nylons\" is what we will shooting with her in this 2nd set.

It is your opportunity to communicate directly with your elected representatives and let them know that they have constituents who care deeply about Tibet.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has long been a bulwark of support for Tibet, from giving His Holiness the Dalai Lama his first parliamentary forum in 1987, to millions of dollars in Tibet support programs every year. But at the same time it is of vital importance that we continue to remind our Members of Congress of their longstanding commitment to Tibet. Faced with the well-funded lobbying might of the Chinese Embassy, it is critical that we speak out to let our elected representatives know of the breadth and depth of support for the cause of Tibet amongst their constituents and ensure that Tibet continues to remain on their legislative agendas.\n\nThis event is a collaboration of U.S.-based Tibet Support Groups, and Tibetan Associations in the United States. The International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) will provide a lobbying training session, help set up meetings for all participants with their Members of Congress.\n\nFor more information, please contact your local Tibet group or contact ICT advocacy team at lobbyday@savetibet.org or ICT at (202) 785-1515.",

Translated into English as the Crane Posture, Bakasana unlocks the key principles of strength for all other arm balances. Start off with the easiest version of Bakasana and challenge yourself by trying some of the hardest versions of Bakasana like Eka Pada Bakasana A. Jump back and jump into Bakasana and learn how to transition in and out of handstand from the posture. Don\u2019t let Bakasana trick you into thinking it\u2019s too easy--come and learn how to be strong enough to truly fly like a bird.\n\nSunday, March 30th, 8:00am - 10:00am: Mysore Style Ashtanga Yoga \n\nThe traditional Ashtanga self-practice with adjustments from Kino\n\nSunday, March 30th, 12:00pm - 2:00pm: Strong Steady Grace \n\nBuilt on the first two postures of the Ashtanga Yoga Third Series, Visvamitrasana and Vashitasana, this class helps you find your true strength in plank and beyond. You will explore these two challenging arm balances from every possible angle, breaking down the anatomical foundation of the postures and investigating the spiritual benefits of their daily practice. You will build up to flowing through these postures in the traditional vinyasa method and then apply the key principles learned through these two postures to other difficult arm balances. These two postures are named after two of India\u2019s most powerful sages and you will attune yourself to their spiritual strength and grace through the practice.\n\nFull Weekend: $195\nIndividual Sessions: $55\n\nAll Kino Workshop sessions will be held at the Edmund Burke School, 41O1 Connecticut Avenue NW, Washington DC.\n\nPlease register at the studio or email elsie@woodleyparkyoga.com.",

Some of you are aware of this program going on with your own students, but if you are not, Justen has a great opportunity ahead of him and he is going to Washington DC in June for his school. Now is where the fun begins and that is the fundraising. So we are here asking for those big black bags that you have sitting in your garage taking up space that are nice and full of bottles, and cans. You know deep down you will probably never make it to the store to turn them in, so that's where we come in and help you clean out your garage and take those bags out of your way for you. \nIf you have any that you would like to donate please let us know and we will come by and pick them up from you.\nWe will be collecting until March 31st. \nThanks for your help  :)",

But most of all, this is your chance to come and have some serious fun with To Your Taste!\n\nPlease note that I am not doing the demo in order to solicit your investment. Rather, I am providing the opportunity for you to see TYT in the hope that you know of people who are looking for an opportunity to invest in a wine-related product and that you will refer them to me.\n\nSo please come and spend a few minutes with me at the Capital Wine School on Tuesday, April 15, Tax Day!

For 35 years, The Holmes Brothers\u2019 joyous and moving blend of blues, gospel, soul, R&B, rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and country has been captivating audiences around the world. Their spine-tingling three-part harmony singing, mixing Wendell\u2019s gruff and gravelly vocals with Popsy\u2019s soaring falsetto and Sherman\u2019s rich baritone, brings the spirit of gospel-inflected deep soul music into every song they perform. Equally gripping is the rhythmic foundation laid down by Sherman\u2019s bass playing and Popsy\u2019s drumming, perfectly complementing Wendell\u2019s blues-soaked guitar solos and church-inspired piano playing. The band expertly blends Saturday night\u2019s roadhouse rock and blues with the gospel passion of Sunday morning\u2019s church service. Rolling Stone says The Holmes Brothers play \u201cimpressive, fervent country soul.\u201d Entertainment Weekly goes further, declaring \u201cThe Holmes Brothers are juke joint vets with a brazenly borderless view of American music...timeless and rapturous.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe band\u2019s new Alligator Records album, Brotherhood, was produced by Glenn Patscha (Ollabelle, Marc Cohn), Chris Bruce (Me'Shell Ndeg\u00e9Ocello, Seal) and Hector Castillo (Brazilian Girls, David Bowie). It is another stellar chapter in The Holmes Brothers\u2019 storied and still-evolving history. It\u2019s also their most bluesy album to date, filled with roadhouse wisdom, late-night doo wop, proto rock \u2018n\u2019 roll punch, soulful R&B and closing with an amazing dose of Sunday morning spirit. Featuring fourteen songs\u2014including eight new Holmes Brothers originals and six carefully-chosen covers\u2014Brotherhood finds The Holmes Brothers at the absolute top of their game, creating timeless roots music. From the rocking Wendell original Stayed At The Party, to the sweet harmonies of Ted Hawkins' I Gave Up All I Had, to Sherman's soulful composition Passing Through, to the doo wop splendor of Popsy's vocals on the Stax classic My Kind Of Girl, to Wendell's gorgeous duet with his daughter Felicia on Loving You From Afar, to the final note of the band's most requested song\u2014and a highlight of each and every live performance\u2014the soul-stirring Amazing Grace, Brotherhood is a testament to the uplifting musical power that comes from the close-knit, fraternally telepathic relationship of The Holmes Brothers. \u201cAs much as I love all of our albums, this is among my favorites,\u201d says Wendell. \u201cWe worked hard. We tried for a live, loose feel and we got it. Glenn, Chris and Hector captured The Holmes Brothers sound most distinctly.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom winning multiple Blues Music Awards to sharing stages and recordings with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Bruce Springsteen, Joan Osborne, Willie Nelson, Lou Reed, Peter Gabriel, Merle Haggard, Al Green, Ben Harper, Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Levon Helm, Rosanne Cash, Odetta, Marc Cohn and The Jungle Brothers, The Holmes Brothers have seemingly done it all. USA Today says that band is \u201cglorious...full of soul and surprises.\u201d The New York Times declares The Holmes Brothers \u201cdeeply soulful, uplifting and timeless.\u201d\r\n\r\nTheir journey started in Christchurch, Virginia, where Sherman and Wendell were raised by their schoolteacher parents, who nurtured the boys\u2019 early interest in music. As youngsters they listened to traditional Baptist hymns, anthems and spirituals as well as blues music by Jimmy Reed, Junior Parker and B.B. King. According to Wendell, \u201cIt was a small town, and my brother and I were about the only ones who could play\r\nanything. I guess you could say we were large musical fish in a small pond. So we played around in all the area churches on Sundays.\u201d The night before, though, they would play blues, soul, country and rock at their cousin\u2019s local club, Herman Wate\u2019s Juke Joint. \u201cWhen he couldn\u2019t get any good groups to come from Norfolk or Richmond, he\u2019d call us in,\u201d Wendell recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s how we honed our sound. We used to say we\u2019d rock \u2018em on Saturday and save \u2018em on Sunday.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherman studied composition and music theory at Virginia State University, but in 1959 he dropped out and headed to New York for a promising job with a singer named Jimmy Jones (of Handy Man fame). His younger brother Wendell joined him in New York after completing high school. The two brothers played in a few bands before forming The Sevilles in 1963. The group lasted only three years, but they often backed up touring artists like The Impressions, John Lee Hooker and Jerry Butler, gaining a wealth of experience. Sherman and Wendell met drummer Popsy Dixon, a fellow Virginian, at a New York gig in 1967. Dixon sat in with the brothers and sang two songs. \u201cAfter that second song,\u201d recalls Wendell, \u201cPopsy was a brother.\u201d They continued to play in a variety of Top 40 bar bands\u2014Wendell even toured with Inez and Charlie Foxx (Mockingbird)\u2014until 1979, when the three officially joined forces and formed The Holmes Brothers band.\r\n\r\nIn the early years, the band worked primarily at Dan Lynch\u2019s, a New York club that featured weekly jam nights and performances by a wide variety of blues acts, most notably The Holmes Brothers. More importantly, the club served as a meeting ground for many members of New York\u2019s blues community, including future members of Blues Traveler, Joan Osborne and producer/harmonicist Andy Breslau, who brought the group to Rounder Records.\r\n\r\nSince their debut on Rounder in 1989, The Holmes Brothers have toured virtually non-stop. They\u2019ve performed in 50 different countries, including dates across the United States, Canada, throughout Europe, and in Singapore, Japan, Russia, Turkey, South America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In addition to their four critically acclaimed Rounder albums, they recorded Jubilation for Peter Gabriel\u2019s Real World label in 1992, becoming the first American group to record for the standout world music imprint. 1996 found The Holmes Brothers starring in the independent motion picture Lotto Land, for which they also recorded the soundtrack. Their albums all received massive praise. \u201cMind-blowing,\u201d said the Boston Herald. \u201cRich and satisfying,\u201d raved The Washington Post.\r\n\r\nThe Holmes Brothers joined Alligator Records in 2001, releasing the Joan Osborne-produced Speaking In Tongues to overwhelming popular and critical acclaim. They followed with 2004\u2019s Simple Truths, 2007\u2019s State Of Grace and 2010\u2019s Feed My Soul (which debuted at #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart), each release earning the band more fans and more accolades. The success of their albums led to multiple appearances on national television, including visits to The Late Show With David Letterman and two trips to Late Night With Conan O\u2019Brien, as well as a rousing performance on CBS Saturday Morning. Profiles and concerts on NPR have put them in front of millions of listeners. They have appeared on Weekend Edition, All Things Considered, A Prairie Home Companion and performed on NPR Music\u2019s Tiny Desk Concert. They played their original song Opportunity To Cry with Willie Nelson for the Willie Nelson & Friends: Outlaws And Angels TV special. The Holmes Brothers have been featured in countless newspaper and magazine articles and continue to tear up the highway, touring across the country and around the world. Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune said The Holmes Brothers are a \u201cjoyous, foot-stomping carnival...a gift to the world of music.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll of The Holmes Brothers\u2019 musical gifts are displayed in full force on Brotherhood. With their deeply soulful singing, uplifting harmonies and unsurpassed musicianship, The Holmes Brothers\u2019 ability to deliver gospel fervor and raw blues intensity is as legendary as their ability to bring audiences to their feet. The band is eager to bring their new release to the stage. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to exposing the new songs to our fans, and bringing new fans to our songs,\u201d says Wendell. \u201cIf you stay ready, you don\u2019t have to get ready, and The Holmes Brothers are always ready.\u201d\r\n\r\nSol Roots \r\n\"Sol is a fierce guitarist and soulful singer\" - Jambase.\r\nSol's talent stretches from fiery rock to laid back jazz, and from funky innovative grooves to soulful ballads, drawing on a deep background in raw down-home blues.\r\nSol has performed on stage and in the studio with musical heavyweights Taj Mahal, Kenny Wayne Shepard, and with the international guitar hero Cool John Ferguson (nominated 2 years -Most Outstanding Guitarist-Living Blues), who he performed with steadily for years. With Cool John, Sol has opened for the great B.B. King, Derek Trucks Band, and other musical luminaries.",

It is your opportunity to communicate directly with your elected representatives and let them know that they have constituents who care deeply about Tibet.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has long been a bulwark of support for Tibet, from giving His Holiness the Dalai Lama his first parliamentary forum in 1987, to millions of dollars in Tibet support programs every year. But at the same time it is of vital importance that we continue to remind our Members of Congress of their longstanding commitment to Tibet. Faced with the well-funded lobbying might of the Chinese Embassy, it is critical that we speak out to let our elected representatives know of the breadth and depth of support for the cause of Tibet amongst their constituents and ensure that Tibet continues to remain on their legislative agendas.\n\nThis event is a collaboration of U.S.-based Tibet Support Groups, and Tibetan Associations in the United States. The International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) will provide a lobbying training session, help set up meetings for all participants with their Members of Congress.",

Similar to today's political climate, our nation was divided over issues of peace and war. However, many of America's military were killed or missing in action and their remains were not being brought home to be respectfully buried and honored. In 1988, veterans of the Vietnam War rallied together their families, fellow veterans, and veterans' advocates to organize a demonstration at the Capitol Building in Washington, DC during the Memorial Day weekend. They announced their arrival with the roar of their Harley-Davidsons, a sound not unlike the 1965 bombing campaign against North Vietnam named Operation Rolling Thunder. Approximately 2500 motorcycles participated in this rally, demanding that the U.S. government account for all POW/MIA's. The group became known as Rolling Thunder and each year since has held an annual \"Ride for Freedom\" to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. \nRolling Thunder Today\nRolling Thunder was incorporated as a class 501 C-4 non-profit organization and today has more than 100 chapters throughout the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. The group is actively involved year-round in promoting legislation to increase veteran benefits and resolve the POW/MIA issue from all wars. They also provide financial support, food, clothing and other essentials to veterans, veterans' families, veterans groups, and women's' crisis centers.\n\n For more information about Rolling Thunder, visit their website at http://www.rollingthunderrun.com",

We will be Presenting Grievances and asking for Redress from Congress. It is Our contention that the most effective way to do that would be to enter a Federal Class Action Lawsuit for every Man Woman and Child who may not have lived to see Maturity between the Years 1913 & 2013. The intention of that is to seek the Maturity of that Loan earlier mentioned. We can easily Show where they did NOT uphold their responsibility \u2026\u2026 By taking on the Responsibility Our Forefathers the Founding Fathers Left upon us in the line that follows DIRECTLY behind that which claims the unalienable rights I referred to above. Those derived from the Creator above \u2026.. Above all else what we are known to own that we CAN take with us to our graves and still hold on to beyond are the Rights to Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness, so as claimed in The One Cornerstone Document that remains solid and un-aberrated to this day. The First Document of \u201cThe Charters of Freedom\u201d instituted by the Founding Fathers, the \u201cDeclaration of Independence\u201d of these United States. In case it has been overlooked by you or your readers or something that you haven\u2019t examined in an inordinate amount of Time since you examined or exercised your rights, let\u2019s trot them out here for a little exercise in the light of The New Day Dawning. \n\u201c--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\u201d That is Our most important right and as you well know with Rights comes Responsibilities as Responsible Citizenry. \n \n Take a Stand for your rights and those of Future Generations of Americans. Stand With The Group who KNOWS what The Constitution and The Bill of Rights ARE TRULY all about! This Group also KNOWS what Patriotism is ACTUALLY ABOUT.\n\n After All it WAS The Anti-Federalists that saw to it that we had The Bill of Rights AT ALL!! This is The Event that will be \"Taking The Higher Ground\" and have Intentions of Initiating Legal Action as Redress of Grievances ..... NOT Instigating Grief for their Fellow Americans. \n\nThe American Anti-Federalist Patriot Party WILL be taking the Field For the Higher Ground and they WILL REFUSE TO YEILD! \nRemember when it comes to the Law of this Land it is NOT all about the \"Letter of the Law\" as much as it is \"The Spirit of the Law\" ..... It's ALL About THE Intent!\n\n Stay with a Group that WILL Stay the Course!! Of Course if you can Point to an Ideal that has stayed around for 237 years and remains sound it has to not only sound legitimate, but show itself to be .... doesn't it?",

In order to do this, we strive to restore the connection between families, the school, and the community. In a city where the graduation rate has dropped below 50%, we find ourselves up against an enormous challenge. And yet we are constantly encouraged by the incredible tenacity of our UrbanFUTURE students at Fanning Middle School and Busch Middle School who are working hard both during and after the school day to improve their grades and become successful young adults.\n\nLast year, 15 dedicated students from UrbanFUTURE earned their way to Washington, D.C. by participating in a rigorous research course and fundraiser. After such a successful trip, many students are eager to take on the challenge and make their way to our Nation's Capital. For most of our students, this will be their first time outside of the state.\n\nIn order to participate, each student is required to select a monument or landmark of interest in Washington, D.C. and spend the semester researching its history and significance. Last year our students were thrilled to visit the places they had learned so much about. From walking the halls of the Library of Congress to watching the historic changing of the guard at Arlington Cemetery, our students covered more ground in the three days than most had walked all year.\n\nWe are expecting over 30 students from Fanning and Busch to join this year's adventure to Washington, D.C. Follow along as students work their way toward this year's trip. Thanks to everyone who helps to make the Washington, D.C. trip possible for our students!",

There are:\n#1. Deep cleaning Shampoo $14 \n#2. Tri-Protein Conditioner  $14 \n#3. Golden Beads Shower Gel $13 \n#4. Hydrating Body Lotion  $22\n#5. Hair Gel: $10\n#6. Hair Spray: $10\n#7. Pouf: $2.50 \n(Price including tax)\n\nUnlike other beauty products, which use chemicals like titanium dioxide in their beauty products, which is not safe to inhale, Royal Spa is made from natural ingredients like Aloe Vera, Vitamin A&E and etc. \n\nIf you want to buy, please put down the number of the product and quantity. E.g. #1 x2  (which means 2 bottles of shampoo)  \n\nThank you so much for your support!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

In-demand and beloved across the globe, their nonstop schedule takes them from the shimmering beaches of Ibiza, to their studio in their home-away-from-hometown of London, to the towering Main Stage of Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas. This summer NERVO released \u201cNot Taking This No More\u201d (#1 on the Beatport Electro House chart). Their new single titled \u201cRevolution\u201d, a collaboration with R3hab and Ummet Ozcan, was released on Nov 11th via Spinnin Records and has spent 3 weeks at #1 on Beatport.\n\n            A small number of DJ-producers can claim to touch the success that R3hab \u2013 real name Fadil El Ghoul \u2013 has earned over the course of his young career; in fact, the youngster\u2019s rapid rise through the ranks of the electronic music world has been almost unsurpassed. If few DJs can say their own sound verges on a standalone and established genre; even fewer can do it in such a short space of time. R3hab\u2019s brand of \u2018Chainsaw Madness\u2019 has created such a stir in the scene that time-honored acts are constantly in line to show their support \u2013 Tiesto, Afrojack and Calvin Harris (to name but a few) are all keen followers of the Dutchman\u2019s signature noise. With three glow appearances under his belt, the district has long awaited his return. Needless to say, DC needs R3HAB!",

Moving from Berlin to Washington, DC in 2008, he has experimented with infusing global sounds into his DJ sets, adding a quirk to the four to the floor.

Today, his sets (including own tracks and remixes) usually consist of global organic bass music, melding raw analog and urban electronic music from Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, the Caribbean, his native Balkans and beyond. He has co-founded a number of monthly and bimonthly global music events in DC such as Analog Soul Club, Tropic of Bass and Meso Creso\u2019s 1001 beats.\"\n\nhttp://soundcloud.com/mettabbana",

We will offer solutions to ending what has become a national epidemic, dog fighting. To \"ban\" or \"abolish\" a breed is far from an intelligent solution but rather a quick fix to what is an obvious social issue.  Now, more than ever before, broken young people all over this country are committing heinous acts against these innocent beings. Time and time again, studies prove the common denominator in prisoners from all walks of life who have committed an array of crimes is animal abuse. Sociopathic behavior toward animals is directly related to humans and currently the breed being victimized by this abuse more than any other breed on earth, are Pit Bull Terriers.  Loving, gentle, strong, compassionate, smart dogs who are being shot full of steroids, mutilated, fed gun powder among other things and forced to fight.  The abuse of animals is not only an ethical treatment of animals issue but rather an obvious reflection of a broken society, which can no longer be ignored.   Lawmakers must recognize that discrimination enshrined in law is wrong and time is NOW for to give the millions of voiceless victims a voice and the chance to finally be heard. \n\nwww.standupforpits.us\n\n***This is a HUMAN ONLY event.  Dogs are NOT allowed***\n\nThe purpose of this event is to educate, bring awareness and in doing so end discrimination and abuse.  Having dogs there will not accomplish or contribute to this goal in any way.  If dogs could over turn laws they would have done it a long time ago.  It's up to US to BE THEIR VOICE and to be responsible and respectful of the US CAPITAL grounds. This is a national opportunity to represent them in a positive way and enlighten others about the truth.\n\n\nPLEASE READ-PLEASE READ-PLEASE READ-PLEASE READ\n*******VERY IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER********\n\n1. BE COOL.  ALWAYS...NO MATTER WHAT...BE COOL.\n\n2. BSL and our Pibbles are a very emotional subject for Pibble owners.  People who know nothing about the breed except what they've read in the media, which is usually negative, can be extremely frustrating but when encountering people who are spewing negative at you, ALWAYS remember point #1.\n\n3. Remember that people will be forming their opinions about Pit bulls and Pit bull owners based on their interaction with YOU.\nPlease don't be the screaming and swearing lunatic. Be the gentle, intelligent voice.  In other words...be like our beautiful Pibbles. Full of , love, patience and kindness.  Be cool. Always be cool.\n\n4. You won't be able to change the opinion of every single person you meet, and that's okay.\nHandle yourself with grace and dignity and the change will happen one person at a time.   Knowledge is power.  The more you know....the more power you have. EDUCATE, EDUCATE, EDUCATE!!!\n\n5. Familiarize yourself with the actual data facts about BSL.\nIf you can't remember them off of the top of your head during a discussion, it's pretty handy to have links printed out to hand to them. If that's not an option, you could politely state that you hear their point and would like to send them actual statistical study facts for them to review. Offer to email them some information to review; ask for their email to do so, or offer yours.\n\n6. Don't go looking for a fight.\nAsk \"Why do you feel this way?\"  Then...listen to them.  This is how dialogue with a positive outcome can happen. People respond better to you asking questions, it shows you care about what's important to them. You'll be more effective at offering the appropriate information if you understand how they formed their opinion.\n\n7. Don't fight a losing battle.\nIf someone is really entrenched in their beliefs and refuses to hear you...just wrap it up with \"I understand if you won't change your opinion. I hear you and I'm really sorry you feel that way. Thanks for you time\u201d. Remember, be cool. Always be cool.\n\n\nWe need each and every single one of you. YOU are what is vital to making this event a success not your Pibble. This is a giant opportunity and TOGETHER we can make history.",

From a kid\u2019s dream come true, to a retiree\u2019s return to freedom. From a family riding together on the sand dunes, to hundreds of choppers carving through the canyons \u2013 the bond is the same. It\u2019s about the passion of the riders and the soul of their machines. Your senses will heighten as the world rushes in, your heart will beat to the pulse of the engine, your mind will race and set you free.

        "description": "The Center for Poetic Thought\n716 Monroe Street NE\nStudio 25\n\n(Photo of The Crying Tree by Patssi Valdez)\n\nFEATURING Carmen Calatayud, Celeste Doaks and Shannon Ward\n\nWhile male poets have received recognition for popularizing the\ncategory of ekphrastic poetry, multiple women writers have heavily influenced the genre as well. Women such as Elizabeth Bishop, Adrienne Rich, Anne Sexton, Valerie Martinez, Rita Dove, Natasha Trethewey and Stevie Smith are just a few impressive female voices who've written ekphrasis. And often women employ what bell hooks refers to in film theory as an \"oppositional gaze\" when writing about art. Hooks believes, \"Spaces of agency exist ...wherein we can both interrogate the gaze of the other\nbut also look back, and at one another, naming what we see.\" This is the ultimate goal when women writers pen art poems.\n\nTo kick off National Poetry Month three women Carmen Calatayud, Celeste Doaks and Shannon Ward will carry on the tradition by presenting their ekphrastic poems, and the visual images that inspired them.\n\nJoin us as we enjoy some wonderful poetry and have an engaging dialogue about classic and contemporary art!",

        "description": "Beyond Darkness, there is always Light; How deep are you willing to search?\n\nTHE MISSION\n\nThe ABYSS, presented by Assassins DC and Urban Artistry, offers a new perspective on producing house dance experiences, by focusing on and honoring the most essential elements of house dance culture: the human spirit and cypher participation. We will be conducting qualifiers in cities around the United States culminating in the final ABYSS Cypher Session at the International Soul Society Festival in Washington DC on April 2014. In the process, we hope to inspire a culture of honesty, integrity, self-discovery, and fearlessness, along every participant's journey to evolved artistry.\n\nTHE CONCEPT\n\nAt the start of any house dance experience are the layers within the sound we call house music. These layers are engineered to inspire free movement, cultural enlightenment and artistic growth. Often, unwanted darkness settles on these layers; a darkness made up of doubt, insecurity, fear, and perceived judgment. However, the human spirit's ability to overcome these inner walls, obstacles, and layers is inevitable\u2026 if you believe in yourself. The ABYSS celebrates the cypher as the ultimate space to explore these layers, share these layers, and create more layers, within ourselves and with each other. And so, the ABYSS calls upon Warriors of Light\u2014dancers willing to go deep, to trust their guts, and explore the depths of the layers in and out of the cypher.\n\n\"Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.\u201d Brown\n\n-Bren\u00e9 Brown\n\nTHE FORMAT\n\nPRE-SELECTION\n\nThe pre-selection round will consist of 1-on-1 showcases, with each participant getting one, un-timed run.\n\nDancers, one dancer, or neither dancer will advance.\n\nAn Advisory Committee, made up of the event organizers, local House Dance professionals will choose 12 dancers to advance to the cypher session.\n\nTHE CYPHER SESSION\n\nThe cypher session will be a one-hour cypher of uninterrupted exchanges between the chosen dozen from pre-selection.\n\nJUDGING\n\nThe 12 finalists will choose a winner amongst themselves. Each dancer will have one vote, but cannot vote for himself/herself.\n\nThe dancer with a majority of the votes will be the winner.\n\nShould there be a tie(s), those receiving the highest number of votes will be given a chance to concede to the dancer(s) that they believe is the winner. If the dancers choose to continue, they will return to the cypher for an additional 30 minutes or the final exchange. During this final exchange, all dancers have the right to concede and proclaim the opponent(s) the winner. If no one concedes during or after the final exchange, the Advisory\n\nCommittee will choose a winner from those remaining, based on technique, musicality, originality and artistry.",

        "description": "Typically the 4th of July is celebrated with a family barbecue and a nice local fireworks show. But in lieu of the repetitious I would like to suggest an alternative. An occupation so to speak.\n\n  On November the 5th 2013 a non partisan, leaderless movement called the Million Mask March brought together Americans from many different political backgrounds without any infighting to peacefully petition the government for a redress of grievances.  I'm suggesting an occupation of Washington until those grievances are heard, acknowledged and fixed.  We have without any shadow of a doubt lost our freedoms and our bill of rights is all but gone, erased and overridden by new laws like NDAA and the Patriot act in the interest of national security to keep us safe from terrorism\n\nBenjamin Franklin once said ''Those who would sell our freedoms for security deserve neither''. I agree with Benjamin Franklin and believe the proponents of these new unconstitutional bills do not deserve freedom but a lifetime sentence in a federal penitentiary.\n\nOne grievance in particular has undermined our democracy and our republic for a little over a hundred years now. The Federal Reserve is a private bank that has been drowning our country in debt for the benefit of a few. Woodrow Wilson even expressed grief for signing the federal reserve act stating \u201cI am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world - no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.\u201d\n\n Thomas Jefferson said ''I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation then by deflation, the banks and corporations that grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.''\n\nThe founders of this nation warned us of the dangers of a central private bank and the apathy of the people towards policy in our govt. Their worst fears have come to fruition and have all but destroyed this country. The american people are down...but not out. We will not go quietly into the night. We will not stand by any longer and see this country of ours and our freedom turn to tyranny. We will fight for what is right and what is ours\n\nI ask you the american people to stand beside us. Starting this July 4th we will occupy our capitol. I expect there will be few at first. But our continued presence in the capitol will show others they are not alone, and before long more will join.  If you are up to your ears in debt, If you are tired and hungry and you see the crimes of this government as we see it then i ask that you join us\n\nBe prepared to accept everybody. Remember that no religious or political belief is inherently evil, they are just tools that we as a society use and that it is how we use and react to these tools that defines us and gives us our morality\n\nMeet at the Washington monument, Bring a tent and a good attitude\n\nNo drugs/alcohol\nNo violence\nNo discrimination",

Join us for the LAUNCH of this groundbreaking new event created and designed for diverse aspiring lawyers and leaders!\n\nThe National Diversity Pre-Law Conference and Law Fair's inaugural event will take place on Friday and Saturday, April 4th and April 5th, 2014 at The Washington Court Hotel on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC - conveniently located just minutes walking distance from the U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nThis event will address what diverse law school admissions candidates can do to be more competitive and strategic candidates.  Even more, it will cover the tough issues surrounding diversity in law school admission, in the law school environment and in the legal profession.  \n\nWe will honestly discuss the harsh realities of the changing legal market, the down economy and the current state of legal education.  We want to help diverse aspiring lawyers to better understand the very real obstacles and challenges ahead in law school, in the job search and in the legal profession that could hold them back from being successful if they are unaware of and not ready to take them on.  We want to provide them with tools and strategies to be the very best admissions candidates, law students and lawyers that they can be. \n\nFurther, we want to encourage them to become leaders in the area of diversity so that they will take on and continue the critical work in their law schools and legal work environments to help make them more diverse and inclusive.  The legal profession has been slow to change and lags behind others in maintaining and increasing diversity.  We believe that we all have a role in making meaningful change.\n\nWe aim to give conference attendees access to information, resources and contacts that can help better position them to succeed BEFORE they begin the admissions process or even start law school.  Further, we will impress upon them the importance of not only making a living, but also making a difference.  We will make them aware of opportunities to serve the community and of their social responsibility to have a positive impact on society.\n\nThis conference will provide:\n\n* Workshops and Panels\n* Keynote Speakers\n* Training/Seminars\n* Law School Recruitment Fair\n* Diversity Resources Fair\n* Scheduled Group Visits to the U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court of the United States\n* Community Service Opportunity\n\nALL law schools and organizations that provide programs or services targeting diverse prospective law students are invited to participate.  \n\nWho represents diversity?  Different cultural and social identity groups including: Native Americans, African Americans/Blacks, Asian Pacific Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Women, Disabled, Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity (LGBT), and Age/Non-Traditional Status.\n\nWe welcome all pre-law students (high school students, college students, college graduates, career changers, working professionals), multicultural/diversity administrators, law students, law graduates, lawyers, law school administrators, law professors, judges, etc.\n\nIf you are a law student, lawyer, bar leader, or diversity professional and you are interested in being involved with this event, please send an e-mail to info@diversityprelawconference.org.\n\nTHIS EVENT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND COMPLETELY FREE OF CHARGE!\n\nEVERYONE IS WELCOME TO ATTEND!  SPACES ARE LIMITED!\n\nUltimately we hope to provide participants with opportunities to learn not only about law school and the legal profession, but more about the critical areas of:\n* Diversity and Inclusion \n* Coalition Building \n* Cultural Competence \n* Leadership \n* Professionalism \n* Service \n* Social Responsibility\n* Social Justice\n\nREGISTRATION IS FREE!\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-inaugural-national-diversity-pre-law-conference-and-law-fair-2014-tickets-9490942665\n\nSTAY AT THE HOST HOTEL - THE WASHINGTON COURT HOTEL ON CAPITOL HILL IN WASHINGTON, DC!!!\nROOM RATES ARE ONLY $159 per night for single and doubles.\nStandard Single: $159\nStandard Double: $159\nStandard Triple: $184\nStandard Quad: $209\nCall the hotel reservations department at 1-800-321-3010 and ask for a room under \"The National Diversity Pre-Law Conference\" block.",

        "description": "What is your only comfort in life and death?\n\nThis question was raised during the Reformation, when many Protestants sought and found Christian comfort through the rediscovery of a biblical vision of assurance of one's salvation, secured by Christ alone through faith alone. The Reformers feared that medieval forms of Christian piety too often were motivated by doubt of one's salvation, and fear about the coming judgment. Roman Catholic piety, in contrast, emphasized that Christian comfort is experienced through the sacramental life of the church, penitential practices and pilgrimages, and the veneration and mediation of Mary and the Saints. The Roman Church taught that the simplicity of Protestant piety cut the believer off from an abundance of practical supports.\n\nPresenters Dr. Brian Lee, Pastor of Christ Reformed, and Barrett Turner, a doctoral candidate at the Catholic University of America, will present Protestant and Catholic positions on the topic and field audience questions. A casual pizza dinner will be served (RSVP Required), and the event will be jointly presented by Christ Reformed Church, Washington DC and \"Faith Discussion Dinner.\" Please visit www.faithdiscussion.org/home/nextdiscussion.html for more information.\n\nRSVP required for FREE \"We the Pizza\" dinner.

They called their afternoon toke \u201c420,\u201d but never envisioned the code word becoming a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nThese days, hundreds of thousands of stoners across the globe celebrate April 20th like it\u2019s marijuana Christmas. In the United States, Washington, D.C., doubles as America\u2019s cannabis capital come 420 Day.\n\n420 Day Washington, D.C. 2014 is chock-full of 420 Day celebrations like Overgrow the Government National 4/20 Rally 2014. There, hemp lovers unite and rally, urging bureaucrats to reconsider their years-long pot prohibition.\n\nHigh, patriotic protestors can roam the National Mall to come up with their own theories as to whether or not the area is steeped in hidden Masonic code. Blazed Dan Browns are free to stop in one of the 10 Smithsonian museums along the park\u2019s outer edges, where they\u2019ll find plenty of visual stimulation.\n\nThough pot might not be legal quite yet in America\u2019s capital, 420 Day events in Washington, D.C., rival those in any other American city, or any city in the world for that matter. Whether you smoke up, down, or out, there\u2019s no doubt you\u2019ll have a blast at 420 Day Washington, D.C., 2014.",

While linguistically there has been a rapid arabization of that region, its retention of its musical culture has been steadfast.\n\nPhoto: Jennifer Samuel\nFlyer design: Maryam Parwana",

Annual Summit. He and his father are among the very few Palestinian Christians who support Israel. His father, Dr. Naim Khoury, had established a ministry in 1980. Today they are spreading the gospel throughout the Palestinian Territories and in Jerusalem, he pastors Calvary Baptist Church.\n\nIlan Sharon, our Israeli Jewish friend will join us as well to share about the special relationship he has with Pastor Khoury.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE for attendees who are not Living Word members: The presentation is part of Living Word's weekly Wednesday night service and will include Christian Praise and Worship in the first 15 minutes and the message from Pastor Khoury is a strong message of Christian faith, however, we believe it is great source of education to anyone that is interested in Israel and the story of the Christian minority living in Palestinian controlled area.\n\nThe Church has (as part of their regular Wednesday night service) Christian childcare for newborns thru 5th grade. The sanctuary also has balcony area which is great for families.\n \nWhat: A Taste of CUFI's Washington, D.C.

Several believers under his ministry have been martyred, including his own uncle, and several youth girls who invited children to vacation bible school. Persecution has always faced Pastor Khoury's life growing up as an Arab pastor during the intifadas.\n \nPastor Steven Khoury is the Vice President of Holy Land Missions, which has been reaching out to the lost in Israel for the past 30 years. Today, six locations around the country are actively serving the community and preaching the Gospel, including Calvary Church in Jerusalem and First Baptist in Bethlehem.\n \nPastor Khoury attended Bible College in Springfield, Missouri, where he received his Bachelor of Science in Pastoral Ministry and Theology. He is an affiliate with the Baptist Bible Fellowship International, the National Christian Foundation, and the Voice of the Martyrs Organization. He is the youngest ordained Israeli Arab pastor in Israel and the surrounding Arab countries.\n \nPastor Khoury is author of the book, Diplomatic Christianity: Standing in the Shadow of Tomorrow's Persecution. His ministry has been a topic in several books. Steven has also done numerous interviews, including recent broadcasts on FOX News and CBN.",
