Don\u00e9s, an early fan of the Beatles and Bob Marley, formed his first band with his brother, but then found another lineup for the newly named Jarabe de Palo. The group's 1997 album La Flaca did well on the charts in the group's native land. De Vuelta Y Vuelta was issued four years later.\n\nJarabe de Palo's Biography: http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jarabe-de-palo-mn0000214553/biography\n\n!Thank you y gracias!\n\nEduardo David --",

Connor was not expected to survive passed 6 months of age.\n\nConnor is now 17 months old and is still fighting! He is beating the odds every day! 90% of children with his diagnosis do not survive passed the age of 2 years old.\n\nThere is no cure or treatment for SMA, and that is where we need YOUR help! Help us make 2014 the Year of the Cure!\n\nConnor and his family were granted a newly diagnosed scholarship from Families of SMA to attend their very first SMA conference. They are so excited to be able to meet other families, and can't wait for Connor to meet tons of strong little kids just like him! The scholarship covers the registration fees for the conference but the family still needs to drive from Michigan to Washington D.C. with Connor and all of his equipment. They will also need to stay for several days. Everything helps, the Smith's are so happy they have been granted this opportunity, but still have many financial obligations with a child in Connor's condition.\n\nThis fundraiser is to help the Smith's get to the FSMA conference, the rest of the monies raised will be donated to funding SMA research at the FSMA conference in June.\n\nHelp us #CureSMA!",

        "description": "Amy Myers: \"Natal Curve\"\nFriday, May 9th-June 7th\nOpening Reception: Friday, May 9th 6-8pm\n\nAmy Myers\u2019 intricate large-scale works on paper originate out of her fascination for the understanding of theoretical physics. The daughter of a physicist, Myers grew up immersed in the language and discourse of searching and theorizing a problem. It lead her into creating work that explored the ideas of structure within the universe and how structure can give way to chance and chaos. \n\nMyers drawings seek understanding to these questions through a continuous stream of thought. Her progression while calculated and specific, like the science she favors is guided by creating new possibilities, or directions while in mid flow. The intuitive decisions she makes within the drawing are expanded upon, like a theory. Every mark created becomes a part of the process, whether negated, or expanded on. Some of her marks are left alone, stranded, almost as if waiting to be picked up again, leading to a new direction, a new theory or phrase.\n\nWorking within a \u201ctrain of thought\u201d Myers\u2019 drawings often create an interwoven symmetrical design pattern that appears like a mirror image. This dualism can call into play the science and the philosophy of life, questions she often poses, or seeks to understand. Within this context a sub-context emerges. Her drawings often take on organic shapes, most often the female form. Myers attributes this to the intimacy she develops with the paper and the medium. Drawing is a tactile gesture, in the course of finishing a piece she touches the paper thousands of times, guiding her hand within the fluidity of the mark, moving in close to create the minute details within its structure. This physicality in form relays a spirituality, an opposite, dualistic counterpart to the structure of the science the drawing is based on.",

Creado con el objetivo de promover los valores democr\u00e1ticos entre la juventud del Hemisferio, mediante un ejercicio de simulaci\u00f3n de la aut\u00e9ntica Asamblea General de la OEA. Este ejercicio familiariza a estudiantes, profesores e instituciones acad\u00e9micas con la labor de la Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Americanos y con sus Estados Miembros, as\u00ed como, con el papel de la Organizaci\u00f3n como el principal foro pol\u00edtico del Hemisferio.\n \n \nEl MOEA es un ejercicio de simulaci\u00f3n de las deliberaciones del Consejo Permanente de la OEA y de los per\u00edodos ordinarios de sesiones anuales de su Asamblea General, en el cual los estudiantes representan a los diplom\u00e1ticos de los Estados Miembros de la OEA donde debaten resoluciones sobre los temas actuales de la Agenda Interamericana.\n \n \nEstos Modelos promueven el desarrollo de liderazgo en los j\u00f3venes, as\u00ed como habilidades de negociaci\u00f3n, trabajo en equipo y resoluci\u00f3n de conflictos. Promueven un s\u00f3lido sentido de compromiso y liderazgo, as\u00ed como un compromiso con los principios de honestidad, igualdad, respeto y responsabilidad en los participantes, quienes deber\u00e1n adherirse a estos principios en todas las actividades del MOEA, y promover una cultura de integridad y respeto por la diversidad.\n \n \nEl Programa MOEA busca involucrar el mayor n\u00famero de estudiantes, mediante la organizaci\u00f3n de Modelos en cualquiera de los Estados Miembros de la OEA. Cada a\u00f1o aproximadamente 1500 estudiantes y m\u00e1s de 100 docentes del Hemisferio participan en estos Modelos. El IDDA organiza el MOEA para universidades, colegios secundarios y pasantes de la OEA. Este \u00faltimo proyecto es una actividad oficial del Programa de Pasant\u00edas de la OEA.  Con el objetivo de que j\u00f3venes universitarios y profesionales puedan trabajar dentro de los campos de estudio de la Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Americanos.\n \n \nAdicionalmente, a fin de preparar a sus estudiantes para participar en estos Modelos, varias universidades en el Hemisferio han desarrollado cursos que tienen como base el MOEA.

RT poses as a 24hr cable news network which challenges institutions. In reality, RT is owned and operated by the Russian government, fully funded by the Kremlin and Kremlin friendly banks and companies. RT was created with the intent of spreading only the messages that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants people to hear, messages which can only be described as intentional half-truths, abhorrent lies, and vile propaganda. This propaganda machine started before the current events in Ukraine but was put into full gear during the revolution that took place in Kyiv, Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Crimea in order to vilify the democracy seeking Ukrainian public and to praise Russia\u2019s opportunistic, illegal land grab.",

It's an early one: 7pm doors, 8:30 show.\n\nIkebe Shakedown\u2019s powerful instrumental soul takes \u201cbig unison horns, slinky bass lines, tight little guitar licks\u2014and blends them with tasty grooves culled from '70s-style horn-driven funk (WNYC Soundcheck).\u201d The Brooklyn-based collective is set to follow up their well-received self-titled debut album with the heavier, more mature sound of their second full-length Stone By Stone, out April 15 on Ubiquity Records.\n\nThe new album was recorded at the famed \u201cHouse of Soul\u201d Daptone Studios in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Notes bassist Vince Chiarito, \"Thinking of all the great music that has come out of the Daptone Studio really pushed us to refine our songs and grow as a band. It was really inspiring to record there.\" The band adds that, \u201cStone By Stone is a much more layered and arranged album. The self-titled debut captured the raw energy of us playing live and the new record is much more of a studio effort. Psychedelic textures weave in and out of the grooves while the horn section offers an explosive response. The songs are heavy and danceable and show our moodier, more melodic side.\u201d\n\nThe seven-piece band\u2014named after a favorite Nigerian boogie record and pronounced \u201cee-KAY-bay\u201d\u2014formed in 2008 and has developed a mighty horn section anchored by tight, deep-pocketed grooves. Following 2009\u2019s debut EP Hard Steppin', the band released their self-titled debut full-length LP on Ubiquity Records in 2011 that Okayplayer called \u201can adventurous trip through time\u201d and \u201cone of the best releases of the year.\u201d\n\nIkebe Shakedown\u2014Barnaby Alter (drums), Dave Bourla (congas), Mike Buckley (saxophone/flute), Vince Chiarito (bass), Jason Colby (trumpet), Nadav Nirenberg (trombone), and Robin Schmidt (guitar)\u2014has toured extensively throughout the US and Canada. Several band members are also currently touring members for artists including Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, Charles Bradley, Lee Fields and The Monophonics. In addition to the April record release show, look for the road warriors to be back on tour in support of Stone By Stone this spring and summer, bringing their strongest live show to date.",

And that is exactly what happened.

        "description": "Indigenous front man, Mato Nanji (Ma-TOE NON-gee), was born and raised on the Yankton Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. Mato\u2019s father, the late Greg Zephier, Sr., was a well-known and highly respected spiritual advisor and spokesperson for the International Indian Treaty Council. In addition to this leadership role, he was an accomplished musician and a member of the musical group, The Vanishing Americans. Formed by Greg and his brothers in the \u201860\u2019s, The Vanishing Americans toured nationally and shared bills with such legends as Bonnie Raitt. Besides being heavily influenced by the music his father and uncles were making, Mato was exposed to Greg\u2019s vast collection of blues records by legendary artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan and B.B. King. Consequently, Mato embraced and began utilizing his own musical talent at a young age. With the experience, love and wisdom of their father to guide them, Mato, his brother, sister and cousin formed the band Indigenous while in their late teens.\nAfter much time invested in practicing and building a following, they began touring extensively across the country. In 1998, they released their award winning debut album Things We Do. The title track\u2019s video, directed by Chris Eyre (Smoke Signals), won the American Indian Film Festival Award and was shown at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival. Indigenous\u2019 music caught the attention of blues icon B.B. King and the young band was invited to play on his annual B.B. King\u2019s Blues Tour in 1999. Sadly, Mr. Zephier would pass away before seeing his children receive this great honor. \nWith momentum gaining, Indigenous\u2019 2000 sophomore release, Circle, was produced and arranged by Stevie Ray Vaughan\u2019s longtime friend and collaborator, the late Doyle Bramhall, Sr. Three more cds; Fistful of Dirt (2002), Indigenous (2003) and Long Way Home (EP, 2005) would follow before the 2006 decision by the siblings to \u2018disband\u2019 and pursue their own musical paths. Mato carried on with the Indigenous name. \u201cPlaying with my family for 10 years was a lot of fun, but it was time to grow and keep moving forward.\u201d \nMoving forward, Mato continued touring and released Chasing The Sun in 2006. Two of the cd\u2019s songs, \u201cCome On Home\u201d and \u201cLeaving\u201d, were featured on the hit Discovery Channel show The Deadliest Catch. \u201cCome on Home\u201d was also featured on FX\u2019s Sons of Anarchy.\n\nIn 2008\u2019s Broken Lands, an intensely personal record, Mato and Leah, his lyricist and wife, pay tribute to his Native heritage. The album decries the poverty, isolation and reality of life on the reservation with \u201cPlace I Know.\u201d The album gains its title from the line, \u201call is lost in these broken lands.\u201d \nAfter touring with different musicians between 2006 and 2009, Mato connected with guitarist/singer Derek Post. Mato took an interest in Derek\u2019s developing career, working together to produce Derek\u2019s EP, Ebb and the Flow. Shortly after, Mato invited Derek to join Indigenous. Charles Sanders, a drummer/keyboard player and band mate of Derek\u2019s, was introduced to Mato and joined the band a year later. The three have been touring together consistently since.\nOf The Acoustic Sessions (released in 2010), Mato commented, \u201cIt\u2019s a collection of some of my favorite songs that celebrate 10 years of releasing albums. Every song that I have ever written began with the acoustic guitar, so it only felt natural to create an acoustic album.\u201d \nIndigenous featuring Mato Nanji (2012) would mark Nanji\u2019s debut on Blues Bureau International and the beginning of his collaboration with noted producer, Mike Varney. Joining Mato on the disc\u2019s opening track \u201cFree Yourself, Free Your Mind\u201d is the soulful Jonny Lang. On it, the two guitar-masters trade vocals and guitar solos. Truly a blues lover\u2019s \u2018match made in heaven\u2019.\nIn addition to his Indigenous \u2018day job\u2019, Mato Nanji has been a member of the annual Experience Hendrix Tour Band since 2002. Playing alongside original Jimi Hendrix band members Billy Cox and the late Mitch Mitchell, the tour roster includes some of today\u2019s blues greats including Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon (Double Trouble), Jonny Lang, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Eric Johnson, and Robert Randolph. \n\nFollowing their 2012 Experience Hendrix Tour, Nanji collaborated with two of his fellow EHT band mates, David Hidalgo (Los Lobos) and Luther Dickinson (North Mississippi Allstars), delivering the hard-driving, blues-infused 3 Skulls and the Truth.\nMato hit the ground running in 2013. In January he performed at the American Indian Inaugural Ball in Washington, D.C. to celebrate the re-election of President Barack Obama.\nFebruary would bring the Mato Nanji-inspired release from trance-blues artist Otis Taylor, My World Is Gone (Telarc). Mato and Otis explore the plight of the American Indian people in a lightning bolt of musical creativity and social commentary. \"Mato inspired the entire direction of this album,\" says Taylor. \"We were talking about history backstage at a Jimi Hendrix tribute concert he had just played, and, in reference to his people, the Native American Nakota Nation, he said 'My world is gone.' The simplicity and honesty of those four words was so heavy, I know what I had to write about.\"\n\"My dad was my favorite musician so he really influenced me a lot with everything. I just felt it was time to pay tribute to him and his band,\" says Nanji. That tribute, Vanishing Americans, was released on May 21, 2013 and promptly found its place on iTunes Top 10 Blues Chart. Blues Rock Review (6/5/13) said: \u201ceach song is brought together with heavy and powerful guitar riffs akin to those of Carlos Santana and Jimi Hendrix, while bellowing, raspy vocals turn a talented guitarist\u2019s vision into a relatable song for many, just as any praiseworthy blues album should.\u201d\nWith each new tour, national and international, Mato and the boys continue to attract new audiences and expand the fan base. They look forward to each opportunity to bring the music to long time fans as well as those hearing them for the first time.\n\nTHE BOBBY THOMPSON TRIO\n\n\nCombining gritty vocals, soaring guitar leads, and a songwriting skill reminiscent of classic blues-rock artists, Bobby wins over audiences with the talent he has built was on the road and in the studio the past 20 years. Having shared the stage with top artists in multiple genres (blues, rock, reggae, folk-rock), he has cultivated a strong sense of authenicity and freshness, while remaining conscious of the legends that came before him.\n\nBobby will be performing songs of his solo albums and other material he has written. \n\nBobby has toured and recorded with SOJA, Junior Marvin, Corey Harris, Justin Jones, and shared the stage with artists like Mick Fleetwood, Chris Thomas King, Lucinda Williams, and Ron Holloway. He received rave reviews for his 2011 release \"By The Hand\", and was a featured performer with Justin Jones during his 2011-2012 'Fading Light' tour. They opened for Gary Clark Jr, Jack White, and ZZ Top, and played a stellar show at the BMI Stage at Austin City Limits Festival in 2012.\n\n\u2022 Press \u2022\n\n\"With 'By The Hand', Thompson has drawn a line between his past and future through these songs of hope and redemption. It is not hard to listen to this record and recognize an artist beginning to hit his creative stride\" - Swampland (2011)\n\n\"When Bobby sings he sounds warm, reassuring - as a result, Thompson's new album, \"By The Hand\" offers something for every blues fan\" - Cahl's Juke Joint Blog (2011)\n\nVenue Information:\nGypsy Sally's\n3401 K Street NW\nWashington, DC, 20007",

        "description": "TO:  Patriots (black, white, male, female, civilian, military, truckers, bikers, militias, veterans, old, young, every American that loves freedom and liberty)\n\nMission: Restoration of Constitutional government, rule of law, freedom, liberty \"of the people, for the people, by the people\" from despotic and tyrannical federal leadership.\n\nAssumptions:\nMillions of Americans will participate.\nAmerican veterans and patriots are energized to end the tyranny, lawlessness, and shredding of the US Constitution.\nGovernment is not the target, it is sound; corrupt and criminal leadership must be removed.\nThose in power will not hesitate to use force against unarmed, peaceful patriots exercising their constitutional rights.\nPatriots may be killed, wounded, incarcerated.\nThere is no hope given today\u2019s technology of secrecy for the effort nor do we want it secret.\n\nConcept of Operations:\nPhase 1 - Field millions, as many as ten million, patriots who will assemble in a peaceful, non-violent, physically unarmed (Spiritually/Constitutionally armed), display of unswerving loyalty to the US Constitution and against the incumbent government leadership, in Washington, D.C., with the mission to bring down the existing leadership. Go full-bore, no looking back, steadfast in the mission.\n\nPhase 2 - One million or more of the assembled 10 million must be prepared to stay in D.C. as long as it takes to see Obama, Biden, Reid, McConnell, Boehner, Pelosi, and Attorney General Holder removed from office. The senior republican in the US House of Representatives will become Speaker of the House and the US House of Representatives will elect a temporary President and Vice President of the United States. The U.S. Senate will take action to elect a new majority and minority leader.\nAs required, the U.S. Congress will execute appropriate legislation to convene new elections or U.S. States will appoint replacements for positions vacated consistent with established constitutional requirements.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Those with the principles of a West, Cruz, Dr. Ben Carson, Lee, DeMint, Paul, Gov Walker, Sessions, Gowdy, Jordan, will comprise a tribunal and assume positions of authority to convene investigations, recommend appropriate charges against politicians and government employees to the new U.S. Attorney General appointed by the new President.\n\n*All actions in Phase 2 & 3 will be consistent with the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDate of Operation: \u201cOPERATION AMERICAN SPRING \u2013 Beginning Of Tyranny Housecleaning, May 16, 2014, completion to be determined\n\nWe are past the point of no return, thus must move forward with an effort to save our nation, as there is no other choice. We are asking, pleading with you, and any others that have resources, national voices, email lists, blogs, FB, Twitter, to call for a non-violent American Spring May 16 2014 in Washington D.C. We must appeal to ten million and more American patriots to come and stay in Washington, D.C. to stop the White House and Congress from total destruction of the United States. It\u2019s now or never. God help us.\n\n.....the law of nature rules. A fluffy, cuddly lamb gets eaten by a mean old wolf is not an illegal or immoral event...the law of nature. When some greedy, self-serving occupant of the White House or Congress, or elements outside America, is threatening our existence, our freedom, our liberty, our Constitution, our life resources, our America, then we fight back to destroy the threat and there is nothing immoral or illegal about it. When the government becomes lawless, then \"we the people\" no longer are obligated to follow the government......there is no law when government picks and chooses for political purposes or personal agenda. At this time the government is performing as a lawless entity......\n\nA duck cannot be turned into a fox; an elephant cannot be turned into a flea; the laws of nature will not permit.\nLikewise, a nation ordained and principled by the laws of nature, sovereign, free, with liberty for all cannot naturally become a nation guided by royalty, decrees, tyranny, elitist, self-serving criminals. The former has proven desirable, the latter has proven human pain.\n\u201cWe can become a nation guided by royalty IF \"we the people\" beguiled by the government in surrender to our lusts for that which we have not earned --for what is not natural --if we have become intoxicated by unbroken success\" as Lincoln proclaimed in March 30 ,1863 call for fasting, humiliation, and prayer--we can very easily heap to ourselves leaders, and with itching ears, be turned from the Truth to become enslaved by the LIE.\u201d\nThe United States of America (elephant) while embracing the \"LIE\" is teetering on the abyss of becoming a sniveling, blood sucking, undesirable nation (flea).\n\nOPERATION AMERICAN SPRING will be a gigantic step in removing the flea infestation that is sucking the blood out of America.\n\nWe see no reasonable, hopeful sign that indicates there are honorable, loyal, mature, critical thinking, experienced people in government that understands the chaos about to rain down on America, nor do they care....our only hope is that \"we the people\" call, organize, and draw a few million patriots to stay in D.C. for an \"American Spring\". It would be the catalyst to draw the line and bring to a conclusion a decision on the out of control government, one way or the other. America will rise up or surrender.........for me, I only go to my knees in the presence of God Almighty...........my knees will not touch the surface as a result of some piss ant occupant of the White House or a corrupt legislator, or outside element...I will fall to my death standing if necessary.\n\nhttp://www.operationamericanspring.org/forum/forum.php\n\nThere is not much time and the only planning necessary is to select a starting date, which we have done, and then show up in Washington, D.C. on that date, and plan to stay for the duration. The goal is restoring the US Constitution as the law of the land, removing the lawless leadership. Will this be a cake-walk? No, it will be painful, and some people may die because the government will not be non-violent; some of us will end up in a cell, and some may be injured. If that\u2019s what it will take to save our nation, do we have any choice? Freedom loving Americans will say there is no choice, we must begin the second American Revolution. Not with guns, but with millions of Americans demanding a return to constitutional government and the resignation of Obama, Biden, Reid, McConnell, Boehner, Pelosi, and Holder as a start...then the constitutional restoration process can begin. An AMERICAN SPRING can be avoided only if the above mentioned officials resign.\n\nWill our national patriot leaders step forward and declare, \u201csend me\u201d, I\u2019ll lead? There are millions of veterans and patriots ready to follow and have said \u201cI will go\u201d.\n\nI urge all organizations, groups, particularly veterans and military retirees begin planning to visit Washington, D.C beginning May 16, 2014. Keep tuned to Constitutional Emergency/Patriots for America http://www.operationamericanspring.org/forum/forum.php for updates and guidance.\n\nPlease bathe this effort in prayer as there is no personal agenda or gain save liberty, freedom, and restoration of constitutional government for \"we the people\".\n\nHarry Riley, COL, USA, Ret",

We are hosting a National Law Enforcement Prayer Breakfast and Blessing of the Badge honoring law enforcement officers on May 15, 2014 during National Police Week in Washington, DC. We are reaching out to our church community for support as \u201cPrayer Patrons\u201d. A donation from Mount Zion Baptist Church is essential to ensuring the success of our event.\r\n\r\nThe date of our breakfast is National Peace Officers Memorial Day, which was signed into law in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy. This is the only day set aside to honor both disabled and deceased law enforcement officers. \u201cOn average, one law enforcement officer is killed in the line of duty somewhere in the United States every 58 hours\u201d (National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 2014).\r\n\r\n A special feature of the Prayer Breakfast will be the Blessing of the Badge Ceremony. This is a moment when local and Federal public safety and military personnel will have their badges blessed. \r\n\r\nAt this event, we are officially recognizing the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nInternational Conference of Police Chaplains (ICPC), a professional credentialing organization for law enforcement Chaplains, which is the reason they are being asked to accept on behalf of all of the nation\u2019s public safety Chaplains. These individuals, (irrespective of religion or non-religion), are always there when we need them.\r\nFraternal Order of Police (FOP) is the main catalyst in promoting National Peace Officers Memorial Day. The FOP has hosted the National Peace Officers Memorial Service at the US Capitol for 29 years and it has been through their efforts that Peace Officers Memorial Day, Police Week and the Memorial Service have grown to over 40,000 attendees.\r\nFraternal Organization of Police Auxiliary for their unwavering support of law enforcement members and families particularly in times of crisis. The spirit of unselfish sacrifice is embodied in what they do.\r\nBlue Knights International Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club \u2013 During the early days of the Memorial Service, there were not sufficient numbers of uniformed officers to escort the survivors. It was during this time that the Blue Knights and their Ladies (who also wear uniforms) filled the void as escorts allowing every survivor to be escorted with the honor and dignity that the occasion demanded. We are proud of their continued support.\r\n\r\n Your consideration is graciously appreciated.

Show @ 7:45 pm\n$5-10 (sliding scale) \n\nFor the last three years, the Syrian Civil War has brought death, hardship, and destruction onto the Syrian people, leading to the loss of at least 150,000 people (at least 10,000 of those killed were children). More than 2.4 million people have fled from Syria, while at least 4 million are internally displaced inside the country. Out of those 2.4 million Syrian refugees, 1.2 million are children. These children not only have had their childhood stolen from them, but lack access to proper living conditions, health, food, and education. The purpose of this show is to raise money for those Syrian children most in need. \nALL proceeds will go towards UNICEF\u2019s work in helping Syrian children.\n\nFeaturing:\n\nFoul Swoops (South Arlington, VA)\nhttp://foulswoops.bandcamp.com/\nDevotional Shammgod rock \n\nNic Fits (Washington, DC) \nhttp://nicfits.bandcamp.com/releases\nOutstanding/On-point punk\n \nAnchor 3 (Washington, DC)\nhttp://anchorthree.bandcamp.com/\nTenely mathematics \n\nLuke Reddick (Alexandria, VA) \nA whole lot of great musical things happening at once\n\n\nNo drugs \nNo alcohol \nRespect the space\n\nSHOUTOUT TO POSITIVE FORCE FOR HELPING TO MAKE THIS ALL POSSIBLE\n\nOther resources if you want: \nUNICEF\u2019s Syria page: http://www.unicefusa.org/work/emergencies/syria/\nTheir latest report on the crisis: http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/Under_Siege_March_2014.pdf",

Economists report that labor participation in the U.S. is at its lowest rate in over 30 years. Despite sluggish economic conditions, some in Congress have put forth immigration proposals to increase legal immigration levels by 50% and provide amnesty to over 11 million people who have entered the country illegally. We stand against these proposals, as they will result in adding millions more to the U.S. labor force, putting millions of American citizens out of work.\n\nMISSION: We are assembling a coalition of like minded groups and individuals to help to stop Congress' amnesty push. Join the Black American Leadership Alliance and other concerned American citizens for our march on Monday, July 15, 2013 at 9:30 a.m. at Freedom Plaza as we demand that our leaders reject amnesty, and pass immigration policies that put all unemployed Americans citizens back to work.\n\nYou can find more info here: http://dcmarchforjobs.com/\nWe will be adding much more info on the website over the next few days.\n\nYou can also like/share our FB page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/DC-March-For-Jobs-Join-A-Bus/383712311734554\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored in part by:  http://teapartycommunity.com \n\nConfirmed Main Event Speakers:\nSenator Ted Cruz\nCol.

Starting this January Excision will hit the road only weeks after wrapping the final string of Destroid live shows for 2013. \n\nEmbracing an unyielding pursuit to push the boundaries of bass music, Excision is continually creating and re-imagining innovative uses of cutting edge technology to impact his fans, as well as the EDM community at large. This 2014 Tour will prove to be his most extensive and most immersive tour experience to date. With an already phenomenal level of production at his disposal, you better believe he has gone even further. He is stepping things up to a whole new level and bringing a monstrous 150,000 watts of sound, which is capable of delivering insanely loud yet crystal clear audio to blast dance floors with room shaking bass in a way that bass music is ultimately designed to be felt as well as heard.\n\nThe 2014 tour also marks the return of the 28 foot wide, 15 foot tall mammoth video and lighting installation known as The Executioner. This custom crafted stage production was specifically designed for Excisions 3D video mapped visual sequences as he DJ's both music and video live on stage. The Executioner is fully recharged and returning as Excision\u2019s on-stage bass bunker, complete with brand new 3D visual animations displayed across its 420 square feet of surface area. This technological audio video monstrosity is equipped with various sliding panels and pneumatics to hide lazers, fog machines, an extensively upgraded lighting system and more than a few surprises yet to be revealed.\n\n\nDirtyphonics\n-\nDirtyphonics, the fabulous french DJ team joins with Excision for his 2014 tour. Bringing their signature style of genre bending madness from DNB, Electro House and everything in between, don't miss a second of their electrifying sets as they set the world on fire!\n\n\n\n\nIll.Gates \n-\nIll.Gates is a Toronto-based composer, performer and educator. Over the past 16 years, he has established a global fanbase and a reputation as one of the most dynamic electronic music artists around. He regularly tours across North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Gates has headlined at such festivals as Burning Man, Shambala, the World Electronic Music Festival and the New Orleans Jazz Festival. His first full-length release, Autopirate (Muti Music, 2008) charted and continues to sell strongly. His upcoming triple album The ill.Methodology and accompanying online course are highly anticipated. Gates was recently selected as one of the Next 100 by URB Magazine.\n\nMany of his contemporaries cite ill.Gates as a key artistic influence and inspiration in their music. While on tour, Gates frequently teaches workshops to grateful and attentive audiences, in which he shares his highly effective approach to producing quality finished music as well as insights into the mentality and strategies necessary to succeed in the music business.",

FB Event Page as the mission...\n\nRestoration of Constitutional government, rule of law, freedom, liberty \u201cof the people, for the people, by the people\u201d from despotic and tyrannical federal leadership.\n\nAssumptions:\n\nMillions of Americans will participate.\n\nAmerican veterans and patriots are energized to end the tyranny, lawlessness, and shredding of the US Constitution.\n\nGovernment is not the target, it is sound; corrupt and criminal leadership must be removed.\n\nThose in power will not hesitate to use force against unarmed patriots exercising their constitutional rights.\n\nPatriots may be killed, wounded, incarcerated.\n\nThere is no hope given today\u2019s technology of secrecy for the effort nor do we want it secret.\n\nConcept of Operations:\n\nPhase 1 \u2013 Field millions, as many as ten million, patriots who will assemble in a non-violent, physically unarmed (Spiritually/Constitutionally armed), display of unswerving loyalty to the US Constitution and against the incumbent government leadership, in Washington, D.C., with the mission to bring down the existing leadership. Go full-bore, no looking back, steadfast in the mission.\n\nPhase 2 \u2013 One million or more of the assembled 10 million must be prepared to stay in D.C. as long as it takes to see Obama, Biden, Reid, McConnell, Boehner, Pelosi, and Attorney General Holder removed from office. The senior republican in the US House of Representatives will become Speaker of the House and the US House of Representatives will elect a temporary President and Vice President of the United States. The U.S. Senate will take action to elect a new majority and minority leader.\n\nAs required, the U.S. Congress will execute appropriate legislation to convene new elections or U.S. States will appoint replacements for positions vacated consistent with established constitutional requirements.\n\nPhase 3* \u2013 Those with the principles of a West, Cruz, Lee, DeMint, Paul, Gov Walker, Sessions, Gowdy, Jordan, Issa, will comprise a tribunal and assume positions of authority to convene investigations, recommend appropriate charges against politicians and government employees to the new U.S. Attorney General appointed by the new President.\n\n*All actions in Phase 2 & 3 will be consistent with the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDate of Operation: \u201cOPERATION AMERICAN SPRING \u2013 Beginning Of Tyranny Housecleaning, May 16, 2014, completion to be determined.\n\nWe are past the point of no return, thus must move forward with an effort to save our nation, as there is no other choice. We are asking, pleading with you, and any others that have resources, national voices, email lists, blogs, FB, Twitter, to call for a non-violent American Spring on May 16, 2014 in Washington D.C. We must appeal to ten million and more American patriots to come and stay in Washington, D.C. to stop the White House and Congress from total destruction of the United States. It\u2019s now or never. God help us.\n\nThe law of nature rules. A fluffy, cuddly lamb gets eaten by a mean old wolf is not an illegal or immoral event\u2026the law of nature. When some greedy, self-serving occupant of the White House or Congress, or elements outside America, is threatening our existence, our freedom, our liberty, our Constitution, our life resources, our America, then we fight back to destroy the threat and there is nothing immoral or illegal about it. When the government becomes lawless, then \u201cwe the people\u201d no longer are obligated to follow the government \u2026 there is no law when government picks and chooses for political purposes or personal agenda. At this time the government is performing as a lawless entity\u2026\u2026\n\nA duck cannot be turned into a fox; an elephant cannot be turned into a flea; the laws of nature will not permit.\n\nLikewise, a nation ordained and principled by the laws of nature, sovereign, free, with liberty for all cannot naturally become a nation guided by royalty, decrees, tyranny, elitist, self-serving criminals. The former has proven desirable, the latter has proven human pain.\n\n\u201cWe can become a nation guided by royalty IF \u201cwe the people\u201d beguiled by the government in surrender to our lusts for that which we have not earned \u2013for what is not natural \u2013if we have become intoxicated by unbroken success\u201d as Lincoln proclaimed in March 30, 1863 call for fasting, humiliation, and prayer\u2013we can very easily heap to ourselves leaders, and with itching ears, be turned from the Truth to become enslaved by the LIE.\u201d\n\nThe United States of America (elephant) while embracing the \u201cLIE\u201d is teetering on the abyss of becoming a sniveling, blood sucking, undesirable nation (flea).\n\nOPERATION AMERICAN SPRING will be a gigantic step in removing the flea infestation that is sucking the blood out of America.\n\nWe see no reasonable, hopeful sign that indicates there are honorable, loyal, mature, critical thinking, experienced people in government that understands the chaos about to rain down on America, nor do they care\u2026.our only hope is that \u201cwe the people\u201d call, organize, and draw a few million patriots to stay in D.C. for an \u201cAmerican Spring\u201d. It would be the catalyst to draw the line and bring to a conclusion a decision on the out of control government, one way or the other. America will rise up or surrender \u2026 for me, I only go to my knees in the presence of God Almighty \u2026 my knees will not touch the surface as a result of some piss ant occupant of the White House or a corrupt legislator, or outside element \u2026 I will fall to my death standing if necessary.\n\nThere is not much time and the only planning necessary is to select a starting date, which we will do soon, and then show up in Washington, D.C. on that date, and plan to stay for the duration. The goal is restoring the US Constitution as the law of the land, removing the lawless leadership. Will this be a cake-walk? No, it will be painful, and some people may die because the government will not be non-violent; some of us will end up in a cell, and some may be injured. If that\u2019s what it will take to save our nation, do we have any choice? Freedom loving Americans will say there is no choice, we must begin the second American Revolution. Not with guns, but with millions of Americans demanding a return to constitutional government and the resignation of Obama, Biden, Reid, McConnell, Boehner, Pelosi and Holder as a start \u2026 then the constitutional restoration process can begin. An AMERICAN SPRING can be avoided only if the above mentioned officials resign.\n\nWill our national patriot leaders step forward and declare, \u201csend me\u201d, I\u2019ll lead? There are millions of veterans and patriots ready to follow and have said \u201cI will go\u201d.\n\nI urge all organizations, groups, particularly veterans and military retirees begin planning to visit Washington, D.C beginning May 16, 2014. Keep tuned to Constitutional Emergency/Patriots for America www.patriotsforamerica.ning.com for updates and guidance.\n\n'INVITE' and BRING EVERYBODY, to Operation \"American Spring\" who believes in Saving Our Constitution, Our free and sovereign STATES and The Republic by restoring the Rule of our Ninth and Tenth Amendment Supreme Laws of The Land, which limit them to only the eighteen powers and spending granted them as itemized under Article I Section 8 of OUR Constitution, UPON our elected and wannabe elected Republican and Democrat enemies of OUR Bill of Rights. Bring our Rights, wages and salaries back home to our States and the people, which have been incrementally usurped by our elected Republican and Democrat despots since the 1913 Trifecta of Tyranny and Treason.\n\nPlease bathe this effort in prayer as there is no personal agenda or gain save liberty, freedom, and restoration of constitutional government for \u201cwe the people\u201d.\n\nThere are several organizations, in addition to this fb Event, organizing Operation \"American Spring\".\n\nRELATED COLUMNS:\n\nhttp://patriotsforamerica.ning.com/forum/topics/purging-senior-military-officers-ncos-martial-law-in-the-not?xg_source=activity\n\nhttp://patriotsforamerica.ning.com/forum/topics/any-doubt-an-americ\u2026\n\nhttp://patriotsforamerica.ning.com/forum/topics/the-uber-presidency\u2026",

International Pillow Fight Day 2014 will be on April 5th, 2014 at 2PM on the Washington Monument!\n\nJust like last year, we will be meeting at the Washington Monument, on the rectangular plot of grass facing the World War 2 Memorial.\n\nOur rules have remain unchanged:\n\n+ Please note while our event has evolved over the years, we still ask that we retain the \"prank\" aspect of the pillow fight, and try to hide our pillows as we arrive at The National Mall. If you can't hide it, come up with a clever answer as to why you're carrying a pillow around (wanted to take a nap while out, it's the chic thing to do and that's why everyone else here is doing it, etc.)\n\n+ Wait until the signal to begin (you'll know when we start).\n\n+ The event is free and appropriate for all ages. BUT...\n\n+ Please swing pillows lightly! Of all events we ever have, this one has the most children involved, so please be mindful who you're swinging at!\n\n+ It is recommended that children play outside the main pillow crowd.\n\n+ Do not swing at people without pillows or with cameras. \n\n+ Remove glasses beforehand! \n\n+ We encourage participants to leave down pillows at home. The less that pillows burst, the easier the clean up.\n\nWe're very excited, as this is our 6th year sponsoring this yearly pillow fight, and it has grown into the thousands! Please spread the word, and remember... have fun!",

In this 8th grade school trip, I will have the chance to see the Washington Memorial, along with the WWII and the Lincoln Memorials. Also, I\u2019ll fly in a plane for my first time EVER, and stay in a quality New York hotel. On top of that, I\u2019ll get to see a Broadway Show, the sights and sounds of New York, and even the Statue of Liberty!!! WOW! So excited!! This trip will take place the week after school gets out in June.\n\n\tHowever, I cannot do this alone. The total cost for the trip comes to $2,500. That\u2019s why my family and I are starting a fundraiser. We need to pay $150 a month, with the remainder due in March, so the money has to come in soon. If you live close by, I am willing to work for you to get the money. However, if you live farther away, like in Chico, then please donate what you can.  All donations will go directly to funding this spectacular opportunity.\n\nSo, remember,\n\nDON\u2019T BE A DORK,\nHELP JEFF TO NEW YORK!\n\n(and D.C.)\n \nCheers!\n-Jeffrey Sanchez",

Please post all your pictures and videos in this event as well as our facebook pages. Please chat in this event and continue to post. \n\nI hope everyone is up for round 2. There are many world protests happening on May 1, 2014. So I think we should join them all. Let us make it our goal on May 1, 2014 to get out and protest once again to help wake up the masses. At this point that is what the protests are doing in many places. Getting us out in the public and the public asking questions so we can educate them. It shows them not to be afraid to get out and protest. With each protest our numbers are growing. Once we have the numbers on our side, the change we seek will follow. \n\nOnce again the focus will be on world wide government corruption. Our goal is to wake up and educate the masses with this protest. Be peaceful and Loud! \n\nOnce again let us unite all groups for this event. Every one is welcome.\n\nTHIS TIME IT IS A 4 DAY EVENT TO REALLY WAKE UP THE MASSES. NOT EVERYONE CAN BE THERE ALL FOUR DAYS BUT PLEASE COME OUT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN DURING THE 4 DAY EVENT!\n\n\nPeace and respect to everyone.",

But according to ancient lore, St. Nicholas actually had several attendants, one of which was the horned satyr Krampus. Whereas St. Nick would reward good little girls & boys, Krampus would punish the bad kids. For 'truly' bad children, he'd even carry them off to later be devoured as his X-mas dinner!  \n\nTraditionally, Kampsuslauf takes place on Dec 5th (day before St. Nicholas Day). Celebratory revelers parade through the night, carousing their way through the streets & warn attendant children to be nice. \n\nIn a city known for its cultural diversity & multinational intrigue, this year we're proud to host the 3rd Annual Kampuslauf on H Street. With a schedule of events that run throughout the evening, Kampusnacht offers a little something for everyone - perfect for families & revelers alike!  \n\n\n- For a more detailed history see Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus \n- For an idea as to the Krampuslauf Tradition see: www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLnl5ZWG4tg \n\nAll parties are welcome to join in the fun!

We will be shooting Mika topless with just nylons on with some unique lighting. \n\n\n\nThird set\u2026 \"Nude Bondage\". We will be using some ropes, wrist and neck collars on Mika for our final set. Mika will be nude and will be posing in various bondage looks. We have a wooden rack we will be utilizing as well as a over hanging hook. \n\n\n\n\nThis will be a 3 hour workshop and we will be getting some amazing shots.

It is your opportunity to communicate directly with your elected representatives and let them know that they have constituents who care deeply about Tibet.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has long been a bulwark of support for Tibet, from giving His Holiness the Dalai Lama his first parliamentary forum in 1987, to millions of dollars in Tibet support programs every year. But at the same time it is of vital importance that we continue to remind our Members of Congress of their longstanding commitment to Tibet. Faced with the well-funded lobbying might of the Chinese Embassy, it is critical that we speak out to let our elected representatives know of the breadth and depth of support for the cause of Tibet amongst their constituents and ensure that Tibet continues to remain on their legislative agendas.\n\nThis event is a collaboration of U.S.-based Tibet Support Groups, and Tibetan Associations in the United States. The International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) will provide a lobbying training session, help set up meetings for all participants with their Members of Congress.\n\nFor more information, please contact your local Tibet group or contact ICT advocacy team at lobbyday@savetibet.org or ICT at (202) 785-1515.",

To give millions of voiceless victims a voice and by doing so, end discrimination and abuse. \n\nNow, more than ever before, broken young people all over this country are committing sociopathic acts against innocent voiceless beings.  Time and time again, studies have shown that people who commit violent acts against animals will likely and most often times do, go onto commit violent acts against humanity.  The breed being victimized by this abuse more than any other breed on earth, are Pit Bull Terriers.  Dogs that are loyal, loving, gentle and smart being forced to fight till the death.  The average age of dog fighters are 13-21 years old.   Questions to consider; What happened to them?\u2019  Why are they so broken?  How do we help?  To \u201cban\u201d a breed is not a solution but rather an ineffective way to try and fix what is an obvious reflection of a broken society.\n\nThe epidemic that is happening in our own backyards can no longer be ignored.  Whether you like Pit Bull Terriers or dogs at all, as a member of society this is all of our problem. Through education and effective solutions we can fix this social pandemic and provide a safe society for future generations of humans and animals alike.  It is time legislators recognize that discrimination enshrined in law is wrong,  factually ineffective and will no longer be tolerated.",

Demand an end to voter disenfranchisement for people with felony convictions\n3. Ask President Obama to commute the sentences of women and men in the federal system who have applied for commutation\nWomen coming together to speak from one voice will raise awareness of the devastating impact that overly harsh drug sentencing policies have had on women and their children and how mass incarceration and the war on drugs has directly impacted our communities. In ten years the incarceration rate for women in general has increased 400% and 800% for african american women.\nWe are organizing buses from organizations from cities and states throughout the country to come together and use our voices as one. After the June rally we will use our organized voices to continue to call, email and send postcards to encourage the President and raise awareness among everyday people of the need to end the war on drugs and mass incarceration of women throughout the United States.\n\nFor Information contact:\nFamilies for Justice as Healing\nRally@justiceashealing.org\n(617) 749-3129\n\nhttp://justiceashealing.org/",

We will be voting on new Proposed Bylaws for the Society, electing our Board for the next fiscal year and enjoy a speech by Marc Mappen about the rise of gangsters in the prohibition era. (note-drinks will be served!) The evening will include a short business meeting, election of State Society Board Members for 2014-15, our featured speaker, and a buffet dinner reception. \n\nMay 14, 2014 \nISS Annual Meeting, Reception, and Guest Speaker \nUniversity Club of Washington, DC. \n1135 16th Street, NW \nWashington, DC 20036 \n6:30 p.m. \n* * * \nAdmission is free to ISS Members and $25 for non-members. \n\nValet Parking Available for 40 cars. Closest Metro: Farragut North -- Blue LIne; McPherson North -- Red Line. \n\nProfessor Marc Mappen, of the Rutgers History Department, author of \"Prohibition Gangsters, The Rise and Fall of a Bad Generation\" will be the speaker for the May 14 Annual Meeting/Reception. A master storyteller, Mappen will apply a generational perspective to the gangsters of the Prohibition era - men born in the quarter century span from 1880 to 1905 - who came to power with the Eighteenth Amendment.\n\n He will focus on the major gangsters, including Illinois' Al Capone. Today the names of these men - Al Capone, Lucky Luciano, Dutch Schultz, Legs Diamond, Nucky Johnson - are more familiar than ever, thanks to such cable TV programs as Boardwalk Empire.\n\n Making use of FBI and other government files, trial transcripts, and the latest scholarship, Mappen will provide a lively narrative of shootouts, car chases, courtroom clashes, wire-tapping, and rub-outs in the roaring 1920s, the Depression of the 1930s, and beyond. Mappen asserts that Prohibition changed organized crime in America.\n\n Please invite your friends to attend. The evening promises to be quite entertaining. Admission is free to ISS Members and $25 for non-members. \n\nISS looks forward to seeing you at the Annual Meeting on May 14 at the University Club. Please go the the Illinois State Society website to respond to the Annual Meeting at http://www.IllinoisStateSociety.org/\n\n Notice: Dues are now being accepted for Membership for the 2015 fiscal year - June 1, 2014 to May 31, 2015.

Translated into English as the Crane Posture, Bakasana unlocks the key principles of strength for all other arm balances. Start off with the easiest version of Bakasana and challenge yourself by trying some of the hardest versions of Bakasana like Eka Pada Bakasana A. Jump back and jump into Bakasana and learn how to transition in and out of handstand from the posture. Don\u2019t let Bakasana trick you into thinking it\u2019s too easy--come and learn how to be strong enough to truly fly like a bird.\n\nSunday, March 30th, 8:00am - 10:00am: Mysore Style Ashtanga Yoga \n\nThe traditional Ashtanga self-practice with adjustments from Kino\n\nSunday, March 30th, 12:00pm - 2:00pm: Strong Steady Grace \n\nBuilt on the first two postures of the Ashtanga Yoga Third Series, Visvamitrasana and Vashitasana, this class helps you find your true strength in plank and beyond. You will explore these two challenging arm balances from every possible angle, breaking down the anatomical foundation of the postures and investigating the spiritual benefits of their daily practice. You will build up to flowing through these postures in the traditional vinyasa method and then apply the key principles learned through these two postures to other difficult arm balances. These two postures are named after two of India\u2019s most powerful sages and you will attune yourself to their spiritual strength and grace through the practice.\n\nFull Weekend: $195\nIndividual Sessions: $55\n\nAll Kino Workshop sessions will be held at the Edmund Burke School, 41O1 Connecticut Avenue NW, Washington DC.\n\nPlease register at the studio or email elsie@woodleyparkyoga.com.",

        "description": "Led by Jeffrey Oliveira Platts and Melanie Curtin.\n\nSmall talk leads to small connections. DC can go beyond \"What do you do?\" and \"How about this weather, huh?\". Maybe you're tired of unfulfilling conversations in loud bars. Or perhaps you're craving more soulful connections with fun people. If so, then you've found your tribe. \n\nThis month's theme is MAGIC and MYSTERY. \n\nTICKETS: https://dcargn-april11.eventbrite.com\n\nWhat's Authentic Relating Games Night?\n\nAuthentic Relating Game Nights are inspired by the Game Nights held in San Francisco by Authentic World and dozens of cities around the world. Sometimes loud, sometimes intensely quiet, sometimes risky... always fun and revealing. \n\nDo you crave a space where you can talk about something OTHER than, \"What do you do?\" or \"Where did you go to school?\" Join a thriving DC community at Authentic Relating Games Night, a space where you can discover how much more FUN and rich it is to BE YOURSELF and actually connect with people. ALL are welcome. Bring a friend, bring your partner or come solo! NOTE: THESE ARE NOT SINGLES EVENTS. (Although phone numbers DO get exchanged occasionally...)\n\n\"This is ten times -- sorry, I mean ONE MILLION TIMES -- better than going to a bar.\" - Melanie C., 32 \n\n\"A unique and FUN way to connect with people on a deeper level. If you're curious about what a \"games night\" is (without any mention of Monopoly or Twister), do yourself a favor and experience this. Trust me.\" -- Adrial D., 29\n\nWHAT KIND OF GAMES ARE THESE?\n\t\u2022\tImagine a playground where you can practice the art of relating with others in a fun, social atmosphere. Game Nights create a safe place within which to play a little more outside our comfort zones. We discover more about ourselves than we might in our everyday lives, all within a lighthearted container that makes it easy to get real, take emotional risks, and grow on a personal level.\n\t\u2022\tThe games are fun, highly interactive partner and group exercises that demonstrate and explore authentic relating. Get to know yourself better while also learning to see and appreciate more about everyone with whom you connect. The games are NOT board games like Chutes & Ladders and checkers.\n\t\u2022\tBy authentic we mean that there is no cookie-cutter mold for how you should be or what relating should look like. Everyone is a universe unto themselves, with their own unique style, personality, and integrity. We hold that everyone is perfect and amazing exactly as they are (including their belief that they aren\u2019t.) \n\t\u2022\tGame Nights are a chance to have fun and party in a conscious way with great people, going beyond small talk and expected (and often boring) social norms.\n\t\nWHAT CAN I EXPECT?\nLaughter. Fun. Energy. More genuine connection. Excitement/anxiety (while learning the difference). Relief. Feeling alive and awake. Conversation beyond small talk. Play. Connection. New possibilities. New friends. Insights. Sparks. Challenges. Personal growth. Transformation. \n\nWHO COMES TO PLAY?\n\t\u2022\tAdventurous adults of all ages who want more fun, rich connections with people. Whether you're tall, short, old, young, in a relationship, single, or \"it's complicated.\" ;) (Again, these are NOT singles/dating events.)\n\t\u2022\tYou want the opportunity to experience an open-hearted space where people are given the space to cut through the superficial and act as truly themselves for an evening.\n\t\u2022\tYou enjoy exciting, fun and very juicy social evenings with lots of laughs, plenty of insights, and sometimes sparks flying!\n\t\u2022\tYou are looking for a real, authentic connection with new people and are prepared to take a risk to try something NEW.\n\t\t\nDATE AND TIME\nFriday, April 11, 7pm to 10pm\n\nDOORS WILL CLOSE PROMPTLY 7:30pm (We really mean it!)\n7:30pm - 10:00pm Authentic Relating Games\n10:00pm to 10:30pm Enjoying the vibe!\nLight refreshments will be provided\nTickets\n$25 in advance (by Wednesday, April 9 at 5pm)\n$35 at the door\n\nPrevious events have sold out. Only 20 spots available. Guaranteed spots are only for ticket holders. Walk-ins allowed only if space is available. \n\nALL TICKETS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. \n\nTICKETS: https://dcargn-april11.eventbrite.com\n\nLOCATION\nThe Viva Wellness Center \n1900 Q Street NW (The Anchorage Building)\n3rd Floor\nWashington, DC 20036\n(1 block from Dupont Circle Metro, on Q St across from Firehook Bakery)\n\nRegulars: NOTE THE CHANGE IN LOCATION.

The National Restaurant Association's anti-worker agenda has blocked minimum wage increases, paid sick day legislation, and kept the federal tipped minimum wage at $2.13 since 1991.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce is another major player in the corporate fight to suppress wages. Of the 20 trade groups that wrote a March 21st letter to Congress claiming \"raising the minimum wage will be detrimental to job creation and low-skilled workers trying to get started on the economic ladder,\" the Chamber spends by far the most on lobbying. It spent almost $75 million on lobbying in 2013, almost ten times the next biggest spender on that list. More info here: http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2014/04/the-political-money-against-the-min.html\n\nThe Chamber claims to represent the interests of 3 million businesses, but in 2012 it received more than half of its money from just 64 large donors.

Some of you are aware of this program going on with your own students, but if you are not, Justen has a great opportunity ahead of him and he is going to Washington DC in June for his school. Now is where the fun begins and that is the fundraising. So we are here asking for those big black bags that you have sitting in your garage taking up space that are nice and full of bottles, and cans. You know deep down you will probably never make it to the store to turn them in, so that's where we come in and help you clean out your garage and take those bags out of your way for you. \nIf you have any that you would like to donate please let us know and we will come by and pick them up from you.\nWe will be collecting until March 31st. \nThanks for your help  :)",

        "description": "Informed by comparative planetology and a survey of the major episodes in Earth history, this lecture will offer a taxonomy of planetary catastrophes meant to illuminate the unusual nature of the \"Anthropocene\", the current era of human-driven planetary scale changes, and reframe our current environmental and technological predicaments as part of a larger narrative of planetary evolution. This saga has now reached the pivotal moment when humans have become a dominant force of planetary change, and geological and human history are becoming irreversibly conjoined.\nIs this a likely or even inevitable challenge facing other complex life in the universe? Possible implications for exoplanet characterization and SETI will be considered, as well as the choices our civilization faces in attempting to create a wisely managed Earth.\n\nBiography: \nDavid Grinspoon is a Visiting Scholar in Astrobiology at the Library of Congress and Adjunct Professor of Astrophysical and Planetary Science at the University of Colorado. An internationally known Planetary Scientist funded by NASA to study the evolution of Earthlike planets elsewhere in the universe, Dr. Grinspoon serves as an advisor to NASA on space exploration strategy. He serves as Interdisciplinary Scientist on Venus Express, the European Space Agency's first mission to Venus. He has also lectured and published widely. His first book, Venus Revealed, (Perseus Books, 1998) was a Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist. His latest book, Lonely Planets: The Natural History of Alien Life won the 2004 PEN Center USA Literary Award for Research Nonfiction. His popular writing has appeared in Slate, Scientific American, Natural History, The Sciences, Seed, Nature, Astronomy, the Boston Globe, LA Times and the New York Times. His technical papers have been published in Nature, Science, and numerous other journals. Dr. Grinspoon has been featured on numerous television (PBS's Life Beyond Earth; BBC's The Planets) and radio (NPR\u2019s Science Fridays, Wisconsin Public Radio, BBC World Service) shows. He has given invited talks at international conferences throughout the U.S., Europe, and Australia.\nThe American Astronomical Society awarded him the 2006 Carl Sagan Medal for excellence in public communication of planetary science. Grinspoon holds degrees in Philosophy of Science and Planetary Science from Brown University and a doctorate in Planetary Sciences from the University of Arizona.",

I will be doing an informal presentation on TYT, where you will have the opportunity to watch the introductory and instructional videos, explore the three games: Taste It!,  Evaluate It!, and Review It! and ask questions about TYT and the business model. But most of all, this is your chance to come and have some serious fun with To Your Taste!\n\nPlease note that I am not doing the demo in order to solicit your investment. Rather, I am providing the opportunity for you to see TYT in the hope that you know of people who are looking for an opportunity to invest in a wine-related product and that you will refer them to me.\n\nSo please come and spend a few minutes with me at the Capital Wine School on Tuesday, April 15, Tax Day! Feel free to bring a bottle of wine to share and use for playing the games. All are welcome, but space is limited, so please RSVP today on EventBrite.\n\n\nTo your taste!\n\nHeidi McLain",

Box Office at 202-885-2587 or http://american.tix.com\nTickets are also available at the theater prior to the concert.\n\nFor more information visit: http://kistatucker.com/american.php\n\nKista Tucker Insights, a company from the Washington, DC Area, and Trajectory Dance Project, a company from Baltimore, MD are excited about sharing a concert at The Greenberg Theatre in Washington, DC.  Without this joint effort neither TDP nor KTI would be able to afford this production.  We could find an alternative space, a tiny theater space, or a sight specific space, but they do not support the type of work we want to present.  We need a sophisticated space with a good floor, more than adequate lighting, suitable seating, and professional production elements.  So, Alice Howes, of Trajectory Dance Project and Kista Tucker, of Kista Tucker Insights got together and decided to share this venue.\n\nKTI is premiering a new work, \"David's Fire.\" with music composed and performed by David O'Malley.  This piece was originally titled \"Astri--or not,\" but through the rehearsal process things changed, and so did the name of the dance.  Additional works presented by KTI are \"Obstacles,\" \"The Archetypes,\" and \"Maga,\" performed by Tucker, herself.\n\nMovement Artists performing with KTI are Clare Davidson, Julie Hart, Tiffanie Horner, Eliza Talbott, Kista Tucker, and Jennie Wills.\n\nTDP is performing \"Ragtime Nocturne,\" \"The Body Is Not An Apology,\" three sections of \"Women of Shakespeare,\" and \"Slight of Hand.\"\n\nMovement Artists performing with TDP are Kelly Alt, Melinda Blomquist, Kiara Davis, Alice Howes, Frances James, Catherine Oh, Sarah Joy Stallsmith, and Alicia Williams.",

For 35 years, The Holmes Brothers\u2019 joyous and moving blend of blues, gospel, soul, R&B, rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and country has been captivating audiences around the world. Their spine-tingling three-part harmony singing, mixing Wendell\u2019s gruff and gravelly vocals with Popsy\u2019s soaring falsetto and Sherman\u2019s rich baritone, brings the spirit of gospel-inflected deep soul music into every song they perform. Equally gripping is the rhythmic foundation laid down by Sherman\u2019s bass playing and Popsy\u2019s drumming, perfectly complementing Wendell\u2019s blues-soaked guitar solos and church-inspired piano playing. The band expertly blends Saturday night\u2019s roadhouse rock and blues with the gospel passion of Sunday morning\u2019s church service. Rolling Stone says The Holmes Brothers play \u201cimpressive, fervent country soul.\u201d Entertainment Weekly goes further, declaring \u201cThe Holmes Brothers are juke joint vets with a brazenly borderless view of American music...timeless and rapturous.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe band\u2019s new Alligator Records album, Brotherhood, was produced by Glenn Patscha (Ollabelle, Marc Cohn), Chris Bruce (Me'Shell Ndeg\u00e9Ocello, Seal) and Hector Castillo (Brazilian Girls, David Bowie). It is another stellar chapter in The Holmes Brothers\u2019 storied and still-evolving history. It\u2019s also their most bluesy album to date, filled with roadhouse wisdom, late-night doo wop, proto rock \u2018n\u2019 roll punch, soulful R&B and closing with an amazing dose of Sunday morning spirit. Featuring fourteen songs\u2014including eight new Holmes Brothers originals and six carefully-chosen covers\u2014Brotherhood finds The Holmes Brothers at the absolute top of their game, creating timeless roots music. From the rocking Wendell original Stayed At The Party, to the sweet harmonies of Ted Hawkins' I Gave Up All I Had, to Sherman's soulful composition Passing Through, to the doo wop splendor of Popsy's vocals on the Stax classic My Kind Of Girl, to Wendell's gorgeous duet with his daughter Felicia on Loving You From Afar, to the final note of the band's most requested song\u2014and a highlight of each and every live performance\u2014the soul-stirring Amazing Grace, Brotherhood is a testament to the uplifting musical power that comes from the close-knit, fraternally telepathic relationship of The Holmes Brothers. \u201cAs much as I love all of our albums, this is among my favorites,\u201d says Wendell. \u201cWe worked hard. We tried for a live, loose feel and we got it. Glenn, Chris and Hector captured The Holmes Brothers sound most distinctly.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrom winning multiple Blues Music Awards to sharing stages and recordings with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Bruce Springsteen, Joan Osborne, Willie Nelson, Lou Reed, Peter Gabriel, Merle Haggard, Al Green, Ben Harper, Lucinda Williams, Steve Earle, Levon Helm, Rosanne Cash, Odetta, Marc Cohn and The Jungle Brothers, The Holmes Brothers have seemingly done it all. USA Today says that band is \u201cglorious...full of soul and surprises.\u201d The New York Times declares The Holmes Brothers \u201cdeeply soulful, uplifting and timeless.\u201d\r\n\r\nTheir journey started in Christchurch, Virginia, where Sherman and Wendell were raised by their schoolteacher parents, who nurtured the boys\u2019 early interest in music. As youngsters they listened to traditional Baptist hymns, anthems and spirituals as well as blues music by Jimmy Reed, Junior Parker and B.B. King. According to Wendell, \u201cIt was a small town, and my brother and I were about the only ones who could play\r\nanything. I guess you could say we were large musical fish in a small pond. So we played around in all the area churches on Sundays.\u201d The night before, though, they would play blues, soul, country and rock at their cousin\u2019s local club, Herman Wate\u2019s Juke Joint. \u201cWhen he couldn\u2019t get any good groups to come from Norfolk or Richmond, he\u2019d call us in,\u201d Wendell recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s how we honed our sound. We used to say we\u2019d rock \u2018em on Saturday and save \u2018em on Sunday.\u201d\r\n\r\nSherman studied composition and music theory at Virginia State University, but in 1959 he dropped out and headed to New York for a promising job with a singer named Jimmy Jones (of Handy Man fame). His younger brother Wendell joined him in New York after completing high school. The two brothers played in a few bands before forming The Sevilles in 1963. The group lasted only three years, but they often backed up touring artists like The Impressions, John Lee Hooker and Jerry Butler, gaining a wealth of experience. Sherman and Wendell met drummer Popsy Dixon, a fellow Virginian, at a New York gig in 1967. Dixon sat in with the brothers and sang two songs. \u201cAfter that second song,\u201d recalls Wendell, \u201cPopsy was a brother.\u201d They continued to play in a variety of Top 40 bar bands\u2014Wendell even toured with Inez and Charlie Foxx (Mockingbird)\u2014until 1979, when the three officially joined forces and formed The Holmes Brothers band.\r\n\r\nIn the early years, the band worked primarily at Dan Lynch\u2019s, a New York club that featured weekly jam nights and performances by a wide variety of blues acts, most notably The Holmes Brothers. More importantly, the club served as a meeting ground for many members of New York\u2019s blues community, including future members of Blues Traveler, Joan Osborne and producer/harmonicist Andy Breslau, who brought the group to Rounder Records.\r\n\r\nSince their debut on Rounder in 1989, The Holmes Brothers have toured virtually non-stop. They\u2019ve performed in 50 different countries, including dates across the United States, Canada, throughout Europe, and in Singapore, Japan, Russia, Turkey, South America, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. In addition to their four critically acclaimed Rounder albums, they recorded Jubilation for Peter Gabriel\u2019s Real World label in 1992, becoming the first American group to record for the standout world music imprint. 1996 found The Holmes Brothers starring in the independent motion picture Lotto Land, for which they also recorded the soundtrack. Their albums all received massive praise. \u201cMind-blowing,\u201d said the Boston Herald. \u201cRich and satisfying,\u201d raved The Washington Post.\r\n\r\nThe Holmes Brothers joined Alligator Records in 2001, releasing the Joan Osborne-produced Speaking In Tongues to overwhelming popular and critical acclaim. They followed with 2004\u2019s Simple Truths, 2007\u2019s State Of Grace and 2010\u2019s Feed My Soul (which debuted at #1 on the Billboard Blues Chart), each release earning the band more fans and more accolades. The success of their albums led to multiple appearances on national television, including visits to The Late Show With David Letterman and two trips to Late Night With Conan O\u2019Brien, as well as a rousing performance on CBS Saturday Morning. Profiles and concerts on NPR have put them in front of millions of listeners. They have appeared on Weekend Edition, All Things Considered, A Prairie Home Companion and performed on NPR Music\u2019s Tiny Desk Concert. They played their original song Opportunity To Cry with Willie Nelson for the Willie Nelson & Friends: Outlaws And Angels TV special. The Holmes Brothers have been featured in countless newspaper and magazine articles and continue to tear up the highway, touring across the country and around the world. Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune said The Holmes Brothers are a \u201cjoyous, foot-stomping carnival...a gift to the world of music.\u201d\r\n\r\nAll of The Holmes Brothers\u2019 musical gifts are displayed in full force on Brotherhood. With their deeply soulful singing, uplifting harmonies and unsurpassed musicianship, The Holmes Brothers\u2019 ability to deliver gospel fervor and raw blues intensity is as legendary as their ability to bring audiences to their feet. The band is eager to bring their new release to the stage. \u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to exposing the new songs to our fans, and bringing new fans to our songs,\u201d says Wendell. \u201cIf you stay ready, you don\u2019t have to get ready, and The Holmes Brothers are always ready.\u201d\r\n\r\nSol Roots \r\n\"Sol is a fierce guitarist and soulful singer\" - Jambase.\r\nSol's talent stretches from fiery rock to laid back jazz, and from funky innovative grooves to soulful ballads, drawing on a deep background in raw down-home blues.\r\nSol has performed on stage and in the studio with musical heavyweights Taj Mahal, Kenny Wayne Shepard, and with the international guitar hero Cool John Ferguson (nominated 2 years -Most Outstanding Guitarist-Living Blues), who he performed with steadily for years.

The tragedy was devastating to Tohoku, Japan, and the world. People lost loved ones, their homes, and even their way of life, Now, three years later, while the world's attention has moved on, the people of Japan are still struggling to pull their communities back together.\n\nIn the months following the disaster, countless volunteers rallied from around the world and came to Japan's aid to help begin the long process of rebuilding. Whether by donating money, organizing events, or coming to volunteer, these individuals showed they truly care about Japan and about the people of Tohoku. They are, in Japanese, Tohoku Tomo.\n\nThis is their story. \n\nThe film includes over a dozen interviews, footage from the impacted areas, and features J-Pop artist Maynard Plant from the band Monkey Majik; Stu Levy, producer of the film Pray for Japan; and host of Tokyofoodcast, Etsuko Nakamura.",

        "description": "Come out on Saturday, May 3 to demand the release of Raif Badawi and be part of a global movement standing up for fundamental human rights! \n\n*****\n\n30-year-old Raif Badawi, a Saudi Arabian writer and activist, was sentenced last year to seven years in prison and 600 lashes. Badawi\u2019s crimes? Founding a website, Liberal Saudi Network, dedicated to fostering open discussion of religion and politics; and calling on his country to respect freedom of religion, belief, and expression, and women\u2019s rights.\n\nAccording to the Saudi court, Badawi was guilty of ridiculing Islam. In the midst of his appeals process, Badawi could soon be charged with apostasy. The penalty for apostasy in Saudi Arabia is death.\n\nTo make matters worse, a Saudi court recently jailed Badawi\u2019s lawyer, Waleed Sami Abu Al-Khair, for his human rights activism.\n\nBadawi did nothing more than peacefully exercise his basic human rights, and seek to help others secure the liberty to do the same, yet he is now in very real danger. Having lost his freedom, many in Saudi Arabia now call for his death. \n\nIn support of Badawi, Muslims for Progressive Values and the Center for Inquiry are organizing a protest at the Saudi Arabian Embassy on Saturday, May 3, at 3:00 p.m. The embassy is located at 601 New Hampshire Ave NW, Washington, D.C. 20037, near the Foggy Bottom stop on the Metro. \n\nThe D.C. protest is part of several demonstrations set to take place May 3, organized under the banner of Stand for Raif Badawi on World Press Freedom Day. Other protest locations include Ottawa, Canada; Madrid, Spain; Bern, Switzerland;  Paris, France, and Tunis, Tunisia.\n\nAttendees are encouraged to bring their own signs, though some signs will be provided.\n\nMore information:\n\nwww.mpvusa.org\nwww.centerforinquiry.net\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raif_Badawi\nhttp://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/MDE23/001/2014/en\nhttps://www.change.org/petitions/free-and-safeguard-the-liberal-saudi-raif-badawy-no-600-lashes",

It is your opportunity to communicate directly with your elected representatives and let them know that they have constituents who care deeply about Tibet.\n\nThe U.S. Congress has long been a bulwark of support for Tibet, from giving His Holiness the Dalai Lama his first parliamentary forum in 1987, to millions of dollars in Tibet support programs every year. But at the same time it is of vital importance that we continue to remind our Members of Congress of their longstanding commitment to Tibet. Faced with the well-funded lobbying might of the Chinese Embassy, it is critical that we speak out to let our elected representatives know of the breadth and depth of support for the cause of Tibet amongst their constituents and ensure that Tibet continues to remain on their legislative agendas.\n\nThis event is a collaboration of U.S.-based Tibet Support Groups, and Tibetan Associations in the United States. The International Campaign for Tibet (ICT) will provide a lobbying training session, help set up meetings for all participants with their Members of Congress.",

Similar to today's political climate, our nation was divided over issues of peace and war. However, many of America's military were killed or missing in action and their remains were not being brought home to be respectfully buried and honored. In 1988, veterans of the Vietnam War rallied together their families, fellow veterans, and veterans' advocates to organize a demonstration at the Capitol Building in Washington, DC during the Memorial Day weekend. They announced their arrival with the roar of their Harley-Davidsons, a sound not unlike the 1965 bombing campaign against North Vietnam named Operation Rolling Thunder. Approximately 2500 motorcycles participated in this rally, demanding that the U.S. government account for all POW/MIA's. The group became known as Rolling Thunder and each year since has held an annual \"Ride for Freedom\" to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. \nRolling Thunder Today\nRolling Thunder was incorporated as a class 501 C-4 non-profit organization and today has more than 100 chapters throughout the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. The group is actively involved year-round in promoting legislation to increase veteran benefits and resolve the POW/MIA issue from all wars. They also provide financial support, food, clothing and other essentials to veterans, veterans' families, veterans groups, and women's' crisis centers.\n\n For more information about Rolling Thunder, visit their website at http://www.rollingthunderrun.com",

Those derived from the Creator above \u2026.. Above all else what we are known to own that we CAN take with us to our graves and still hold on to beyond are the Rights to Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness, so as claimed in The One Cornerstone Document that remains solid and un-aberrated to this day. The First Document of \u201cThe Charters of Freedom\u201d instituted by the Founding Fathers, the \u201cDeclaration of Independence\u201d of these United States. In case it has been overlooked by you or your readers or something that you haven\u2019t examined in an inordinate amount of Time since you examined or exercised your rights, let\u2019s trot them out here for a little exercise in the light of The New Day Dawning. \n\u201c--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.\u201d That is Our most important right and as you well know with Rights comes Responsibilities as Responsible Citizenry. \n \n Take a Stand for your rights and those of Future Generations of Americans. Stand With The Group who KNOWS what The Constitution and The Bill of Rights ARE TRULY all about! This Group also KNOWS what Patriotism is ACTUALLY ABOUT.\n\n After All it WAS The Anti-Federalists that saw to it that we had The Bill of Rights AT ALL!! This is The Event that will be \"Taking The Higher Ground\" and have Intentions of Initiating Legal Action as Redress of Grievances ..... NOT Instigating Grief for their Fellow Americans. \n\nThe American Anti-Federalist Patriot Party WILL be taking the Field For the Higher Ground and they WILL REFUSE TO YEILD! \nRemember when it comes to the Law of this Land it is NOT all about the \"Letter of the Law\" as much as it is \"The Spirit of the Law\" ..... It's ALL About THE Intent!\n\n Stay with a Group that WILL Stay the Course!! Of Course if you can Point to an Ideal that has stayed around for 237 years and remains sound it has to not only sound legitimate, but show itself to be .... doesn't it?",

In order to do this, we strive to restore the connection between families, the school, and the community. In a city where the graduation rate has dropped below 50%, we find ourselves up against an enormous challenge. And yet we are constantly encouraged by the incredible tenacity of our UrbanFUTURE students at Fanning Middle School and Busch Middle School who are working hard both during and after the school day to improve their grades and become successful young adults.\n\nLast year, 15 dedicated students from UrbanFUTURE earned their way to Washington, D.C. by participating in a rigorous research course and fundraiser. After such a successful trip, many students are eager to take on the challenge and make their way to our Nation's Capital. For most of our students, this will be their first time outside of the state.\n\nIn order to participate, each student is required to select a monument or landmark of interest in Washington, D.C. and spend the semester researching its history and significance. Last year our students were thrilled to visit the places they had learned so much about. From walking the halls of the Library of Congress to watching the historic changing of the guard at Arlington Cemetery, our students covered more ground in the three days than most had walked all year.\n\nWe are expecting over 30 students from Fanning and Busch to join this year's adventure to Washington, D.C. Follow along as students work their way toward this year's trip. Thanks to everyone who helps to make the Washington, D.C. trip possible for our students!",

We are calling on the President to use his authority to expand relief for immigrant families and give them the breathing room needed to fully participate and push forward the immigration reform debate.\n\nIn 11 million households across the U.S., children are missing their fathers, women are left with the difficult task of raising families without their partners, and the deep connections between members in mixed status families and communities are severed. These numbers continue to grow as the current deportation crisis tears apart 1,100 more families each day.\n\nMore than ever the time is NOW for the President to stop deportations and grant relief without delay. Together, we say #Not1More. \n\n****\n\u00a1\u00danete a la Alianza Nacional de Trabajadoras del Hogar, Acci\u00f3n Nacional del Pueblo, La Red Nacional de Jornaleros y amigos para una acci\u00f3n creativa en lunes, 28 de abril 2014 a las 9:00 am frente a la Casa Blanca para expresar nuestra consternaci\u00f3n por la pol\u00edtica de deportaciones del presidente Obama, e instarlo a actuar con rapidez para detener las deportaciones y abordar las prioridades de las mujeres, los ni\u00f1os y las familias. \n\nEn 11 millones de hogares a trav\u00e9s de los EE.UU., los ni\u00f1os viven con el temor que se van a llevar los padres, las madres y los padres se convierten en padres solteros de un dia para otro y se quedan con la tarea dificil de criar a sus familias sin sus parejas, y las conexiones profundas entre comunidades y miembros de familias de estatus mixto est\u00e1n siendo cortadas. Estos n\u00fameros siguen creciendo, en la crisis actual de las deportaci\u00f3nes 1100 m\u00e1s familias estan siendo separados cada d\u00eda.\n\nQueremos que el President ponga un alto a las deportaciones ahora.

In-demand and beloved across the globe, their nonstop schedule takes them from the shimmering beaches of Ibiza, to their studio in their home-away-from-hometown of London, to the towering Main Stage of Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas. This summer NERVO released \u201cNot Taking This No More\u201d (#1 on the Beatport Electro House chart). Their new single titled \u201cRevolution\u201d, a collaboration with R3hab and Ummet Ozcan, was released on Nov 11th via Spinnin Records and has spent 3 weeks at #1 on Beatport.\n\n            A small number of DJ-producers can claim to touch the success that R3hab \u2013 real name Fadil El Ghoul \u2013 has earned over the course of his young career; in fact, the youngster\u2019s rapid rise through the ranks of the electronic music world has been almost unsurpassed. If few DJs can say their own sound verges on a standalone and established genre; even fewer can do it in such a short space of time. R3hab\u2019s brand of \u2018Chainsaw Madness\u2019 has created such a stir in the scene that time-honored acts are constantly in line to show their support \u2013 Tiesto, Afrojack and Calvin Harris (to name but a few) are all keen followers of the Dutchman\u2019s signature noise. With three glow appearances under his belt, the district has long awaited his return. Needless to say, DC needs R3HAB!",

        "description": "Looking for a way to have fun and to fight cancer? \n\nThe second annual Nike Women's Half Marathon, a race to benefit The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, will take place along the historic streets of Washington, D.C. on Sunday, April 27, 2014. The organizers are looking to NCAWPA to provide another great group of enthusiastic volunteers. They loved us last year and want us back!\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nHOW DO I SIGN UP? [UPDATED 4/17/14]\n\nSend your\n1. Name\n2. Email Address\n3. Shirt size\nto sharon.hong@ncawpa.org\n\nThe online system has capped our job site so the organizer needs to (manually) add new volunteers to the group on the back end (you'll be sent a waiver once she gets your email address).\n\nWE NEED 12 MORE PEOPLE TO MAKE 40 VOLUNTEERS!!!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the event\nThe Nike Women's Marathon began in 2004 in San Francisco, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Joan Benoit Samuelson's historic victory in the first women's marathon in the Olympics. This year, the Nike Women's Half Marathon has again sold out, with the race having created a platform for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society to raise over $134 million dollars through its Team In Training program's partnership with the Nike Women's Marathon. The Nike Women's Marathon race series provides a premium event experience that annually celebrates the strength, determination, and accomplishments of women worldwide.\n\n\nWHAT CAPITAL CITY DRAGONS NEED: 40 volunteers\nDATE: Sunday, April 27, 2014\nVOLUNTEER SHIFT STARTS: 5:00 am (because the race starts at 7:00 am)\nVOLUNTEER SHIFT ENDS: 8:00am\n\nDUTIES: Get ready to encourage and cheer on runners as you help organize and manage the corrals as the official Pace Tape Holders at the Start Line. You'll be assisting in maintaining pace groups before they head out on their run.\n\nMore concrete details will come as we get updates from the organizers.\n\n\nWHY VOLUNTEER?\nStraight from the NCAWPA website: \"Community service is the main focus of NCAWPA.\" Although most of our community service activities relate to water/boating, it doesn't always have to be about paddling all the time (gasp!) and the Nike Women's Half Marathon in DC needs our help.\n\nKeep in mind that this event supports women's participation in sports, just as NCAWPA supports women's participation in paddling sports. (FYI, males can run in the event but the focus is on getting more women active and fit).\n\n\nNEED MORE REASONS? OK then...\nThe event organizers are willing to again donate to the Capital City Dragons Youth Team fund if we can produce 40 volunteers!\n\nYou'll get a free official race volunteer t-shirt commemorating the second annual Nike Women's Half Marathon in DC.\n\n- You do NOT need to be a NCAWPA member to volunteer but if you are bringing family or friends and they plan to volunteer with you, sign them up above.\n- I do not have coordinator access to anything submitted into the system this year (their staff organizes the Start/Finish Line volunteers) so ensure you sign up early (to reserve your t-shirt size) and accurately!\n\nAnd if you can't make it to volunteering this year, feel free to forward this email and send someone in your place!\n\n\nThanks in advance for your support,\nSharon Hong, MSW, LGSW\nNCAWPA Youth Program Coordinator\nQuestions: youth@ncawpa.org\n\n--------------INFO/RESOURCES--------------[ADDED 4/17/14]\nNike FAQs: http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/running/run-nike-women/we-run-dc/faqs\n\nWHERE DO I PARK FOR RACE DAY?\nThere will be no designated race day parking available.

Moving from Berlin to Washington, DC in 2008, he has experimented with infusing global sounds into his DJ sets, adding a quirk to the four to the floor.

Today, his sets (including own tracks and remixes) usually consist of global organic bass music, melding raw analog and urban electronic music from Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, the Caribbean, his native Balkans and beyond. He has co-founded a number of monthly and bimonthly global music events in DC such as Analog Soul Club, Tropic of Bass and Meso Creso\u2019s 1001 beats.\"\n\nhttp://soundcloud.com/mettabbana",

We will offer solutions to ending what has become a national epidemic, dog fighting. To \"ban\" or \"abolish\" a breed is far from an intelligent solution but rather a quick fix to what is an obvious social issue.  Now, more than ever before, broken young people all over this country are committing heinous acts against these innocent beings. Time and time again, studies prove the common denominator in prisoners from all walks of life who have committed an array of crimes is animal abuse. Sociopathic behavior toward animals is directly related to humans and currently the breed being victimized by this abuse more than any other breed on earth, are Pit Bull Terriers.  Loving, gentle, strong, compassionate, smart dogs who are being shot full of steroids, mutilated, fed gun powder among other things and forced to fight.  The abuse of animals is not only an ethical treatment of animals issue but rather an obvious reflection of a broken society, which can no longer be ignored.   Lawmakers must recognize that discrimination enshrined in law is wrong and time is NOW for to give the millions of voiceless victims a voice and the chance to finally be heard. \n\nwww.standupforpits.us\n\n***This is a HUMAN ONLY event.  Dogs are NOT allowed***\n\nThe purpose of this event is to educate, bring awareness and in doing so end discrimination and abuse.  Having dogs there will not accomplish or contribute to this goal in any way.  If dogs could over turn laws they would have done it a long time ago.  It's up to US to BE THEIR VOICE and to be responsible and respectful of the US CAPITAL grounds. This is a national opportunity to represent them in a positive way and enlighten others about the truth.\n\n\nPLEASE READ-PLEASE READ-PLEASE READ-PLEASE READ\n*******VERY IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER********\n\n1. BE COOL.  ALWAYS...NO MATTER WHAT...BE COOL.\n\n2. BSL and our Pibbles are a very emotional subject for Pibble owners.  People who know nothing about the breed except what they've read in the media, which is usually negative, can be extremely frustrating but when encountering people who are spewing negative at you, ALWAYS remember point #1.\n\n3. Remember that people will be forming their opinions about Pit bulls and Pit bull owners based on their interaction with YOU.\nPlease don't be the screaming and swearing lunatic. Be the gentle, intelligent voice.  In other words...be like our beautiful Pibbles. Full of , love, patience and kindness.  Be cool. Always be cool.\n\n4. You won't be able to change the opinion of every single person you meet, and that's okay.\nHandle yourself with grace and dignity and the change will happen one person at a time.   Knowledge is power.  The more you know....the more power you have. EDUCATE, EDUCATE, EDUCATE!!!\n\n5. Familiarize yourself with the actual data facts about BSL.\nIf you can't remember them off of the top of your head during a discussion, it's pretty handy to have links printed out to hand to them. If that's not an option, you could politely state that you hear their point and would like to send them actual statistical study facts for them to review. Offer to email them some information to review; ask for their email to do so, or offer yours.\n\n6. Don't go looking for a fight.\nAsk \"Why do you feel this way?\"  Then...listen to them.  This is how dialogue with a positive outcome can happen. People respond better to you asking questions, it shows you care about what's important to them. You'll be more effective at offering the appropriate information if you understand how they formed their opinion.\n\n7. Don't fight a losing battle.\nIf someone is really entrenched in their beliefs and refuses to hear you...just wrap it up with \"I understand if you won't change your opinion. I hear you and I'm really sorry you feel that way. Thanks for you time\u201d. Remember, be cool. Always be cool.\n\n\nWe need each and every single one of you. YOU are what is vital to making this event a success not your Pibble. This is a giant opportunity and TOGETHER we can make history.",

But American Indians are disproportionally affected by poverty, hunger, unemployment, homelessness, etc.  Despite what Washington football team owner Dan Snyder has said, these aren't just \"unfortunate facts,\u201d but are directly related to the expansion and development of American capitalism.   \n\nEver since Europeans came to this continent, there has been conflict between natives and non-natives.  American capitalism could not have developed into the power it is today without stolen land and the slaughter of American Indians.  This didn't happen without a fight, and there are stories throughout history of American Indians fighting back.  \n\nAmerican Indians are still fighting to this day. The Idle No More movement that started in Canada has reinvigorated a fight for indigenous rights in North America.  Now the Cowboy-Indian Alliance, an alliance of American Indians, ranchers, and farmers, is coming to D.C. April 22-27 to pressure the government to reject the Keystone XL pipeline, which would damage our lands in many ways.   \n\nCome learn more about the fight for American Indians rights, both past and present, and how we can build solidarity for the fight to come.",

        "description": "The Speed Traders Workshop\n\nHow Banks, Hedge and Mutual Funds and Brokers Battle Markets 'RIGGED' by Wall Street's 'Flash Boys', High-frequency Trading, Exchanges and Dark Pools\n\nCourse Director\nEdgar Perez\nAuthor of The Speed Traders and Knightmare on Wall Street\n\nGlobal scrutiny of high-frequency trading and whether it gives some investors unfair advantage has intensified amid government probes and the March 31, 2014 publication of \"Flash Boys\" by Michael Lewis. While those examinations have focused mostly on U.S. equity markets, such as dark pools run by banks and broker-dealers and exchanges owned by companies including Nasdaq OMX, IntercontinentalExchange Group's NYSE Euronext and Bats Global Markets, high-frequency traders are active internationally in futures, FX and fixed income markets, as they also run multi-asset strategies.\n\nHigh-frequency traders have been called many things, from emerging masters of the universe and market pioneers to exploiters, computer geeks, and even predators and thieves. Everyone in the business of investing has an opinion of speed traders, but how many really understand how they operate? The shadow people of the investing world, today's high-frequency traders have decidedly kept a low profile, until now.\n\nThe Speed Traders Workshop, the first and most comprehensive initiation to the world of high-frequency trading, opens the door to the secretive world of computerized low-latency trading, the most controversial form of investing today; in the name of protecting the algorithms they have spent so much time perfecting, speed traders almost never talk to the press and try to disclose as little as possible about how they operate.\n\nThe Speed Traders Workshop covers the latest research currently available and reveals how high-frequency trading players are operating in global markets and driving the development of electronic trading at breakneck speeds from the U.S. and Europe to Japan, India, and Brazil. The \u201cflash crash\u201d, the suspended BATS IPO, the botched Facebook IPO, Knight Capital's trading malfunction and NASDAQ's Flash Freeze are just a few of the milestones in the history of high-frequency trading that will be dissected with participants.\n\n\"Edgar Perez is THE expert on high-frequency trading.\"\nLiz Claman, Anchor, FOX Business News \n\n\"Perez illuminates the world of speed.\"\nBrenda Jubin, Contributor, Seeking Alpha\n\n\"There is a new day in trading and speed is the key.\nEdgar Perez is the poster child.\"\nEugene Steele, Managing Partner, Trading Rooms\n\nWorkshop Highlights\n\n   * The first and most comprehensive global initiation to the world of high-frequency trading\n   * Key enablers of high-frequency trading in the U.S., Europe and Asia\n   * Strategies high-frequency traders leverage to find alpha in up and down markets\n   * Techniques to detect and avoid high-frequency trading in the markets\n   * Regulatory framework and initiatives for speed trading\n   * Latest update on high-frequency trading in the world and current regulatory initiatives after the \"flash crash\" and Michael Lewis' \"Flash Boys\"\n   * Up-to-date review of the future of high-frequency trading\n   * Study materials developed by Edgar Perez, the author of the most popular books on the subject of high-frequency trading, The Speed Traders and Knightmare on Wall Street, commentator on Bloomberg, CNN, CNBC, FOX Business News and other business media, and a well-known presenter in conferences and seminars in America, Europe and Asia",

Borgore destroys dancefloors with his heavy bass and dirty lyrics that keep his consistently sold out shows in a twerking frenzy of cake and sweat. Borgore knows how to bring out the fun, crazy and wild partier in all of us, and he does it without the violent and dark thrasher lyrics typically heard from his predecessors in heavy metal and rock groups.\n\nHaving risen to fame with chart successes such as \u2018Let the Bass Kick\u2019 and \u2018Aftershock,\u2019 Chuckie\u2019s career has continued to trace an exponentially upward trajectory that has escalated him into a world-renowned figurehead and tastemaker. As a pioneer of the rapidly proliferating Dirty Dutch sound, which has burst on to the international stage with its fusion of big grooves and livewire synths, he has taken his diverse musical palette worldwide and continues to spread the Chuckie flavour with his explosive beats, impeccable mixing and inimitable charisma. Born in South America, Chuckie (real name Clyde Sergio Narain) later moved to The Netherlands where his passion for hip-hop and electronic music grew and eventually manifested itself in his decision to become a DJ and producer. His energetic mixing skills coupled with an ability to effortlessly blend different musical styles has made Chuckie one of the most in- demand DJs in the world.\n\nCONNOR CRUISE brings a unique style to the decks, blending together big room house, EDM anthems, and an eclectic mix of other influences featuring the likes of Tiesto, Quintino, Knife Party, Tommy Trash and more. His upbeat sets have taken him around the world, deejaying at some of the most well-known nightclubs in the country, including Create (Los Angeles), Studio Paris (Chicago), Pacha (New York), and countless others; this year alone, he will have also played overseas in Guatemala, Panama, Spain, Germany, Singapore, Philippines and the Dominican Republic.",

Members Sebastian Furrer and Alexander Bj\u00f6rklund were two Stockholm producers who joined forces in 2011. After meeting manager Ash Pournouri, the three combined two of the favorite strains of dance music -- dubstep and house -- for a sound they called \"dubhouse.\" Bootlegs of Swedish House Mafia and Kanye West tracks introduced their dubhouse to loyal EDM fans, and through Pournouri, they were able to bring this sound to the masses when they made their official debut in 2011 with a remix of Avicii's single \"Sweet Dreams.\" They were signed by Avicii's and Pournouri's management company, At Night Management, that same year and hired to do an official remix of Swedish House Mafia's \"Save the World.\" Released at the same time, their bootleg remix of Adele's \"Set Fire to the Rain\" was nearly as significant, climbing to number one on Hype Machine's chart of trending downloads. Gigs at XS and Surrender in Las Vegas, Ushuaia in Ibiza, and Radio City Music Hall in New York City followed, along with main stage slots at festivals like Creamfields, Ultra, and Tomorrowland. In 2012, they released their single \"Beam Me Up,\" and the Strictly Rhythm label collected some of their best remixes and productions on the mix CD Strictly Cazzette. That same year, they made headlines when their debut EP became the first major debut issued exclusively to a streaming music site. The EP, titled Eject, appeared on Spotify in November of that year.",

There will be Q & A sessions, small group discussions, and informational handouts.\n\nSpeakers will include:\n\nMichael Hendricks, Ph.D. holds his doctorate in clinical psychology from The American University.

Women such as Elizabeth Bishop, Adrienne Rich, Anne Sexton, Valerie Martinez, Rita Dove, Natasha Trethewey and Stevie Smith are just a few impressive female voices who've written ekphrasis. And often women employ what bell hooks refers to in film theory as an \"oppositional gaze\" when writing about art. Hooks believes, \"Spaces of agency exist ...wherein we can both interrogate the gaze of the other\nbut also look back, and at one another, naming what we see.\" This is the ultimate goal when women writers pen art poems.\n\nTo kick off National Poetry Month three women Carmen Calatayud, Celeste Doaks and Shannon Ward will carry on the tradition by presenting their ekphrastic poems, and the visual images that inspired them.\n\nJoin us as we enjoy some wonderful poetry and have an engaging dialogue about classic and contemporary art!",

        "description": "Join the DC Trainers Network for the May Skillshare: Theater of the Oppressed\n\nTheater of the Oppressed is a theoretical framework and set of techniques developed by Brazilian director, artist and activist Augusto Boal. Recognizing that humans have a unique ability to take action in the world while simultaneously observing themselves in action, Boal believed that the human was a self-contained theater, actor and spectator in one. Because we can observe ourselves in action, we can amend, adjust and alter our actions to have different impact and to change our world.\nTheatre of the Oppressed engages people in discovery, critical reflection and dialogue and the process of liberation.\n\nMay facilitator Annalisa Dias has taught theater of the oppressed nationally and internationally. During this skillshare she'll share games and techniques designed to help inspire the practice of freedom. \n                                               ***\n\nThe DC Trainers Network monthly skillshare is a structured, interactive space where people can share skills and gain confidence in their training abilities and everybody is both a teacher and a learner. It strives to provide an inclusive practice space to experiment with different approaches for learning and teaching. This skillshare seeks to strengthen the DC activist community\u2019s ability to meet the needs of progressive social movements.",

Elena, a young Brazilian woman, moves to New York with the same dream as her mother had, to become a movie actress. She leaves behind her childhood spent in hiding during the years of the military dictatorship. She also leaves Petra, her seven-year-old sister. Two decades later, Petra also becomes an actress and goes to New York in search of Elena. She only has a few clues about her: home movies, newspaper clippings, a diary and letters. ELENA is a film about the persistence of those memories, the irreversibility of that loss, and the impact the absence of her sister had on the seven-year-old girl. (In Portuguese with English subtitles). (http://tinyurl.com/elena-trailer).\n\nOur screening will be followed by Q&A discussion with director Petra Costa, Prof. Renato Alvim of American University and staff from the Embassy of Brazil.\n\nBloombars, in association with the Washington Portuguese Language Meetup (WPLM), is proud to present monthly films which highlight the best of Lusophone culture.\n\n*Suggested Donation: $10.

        "description": "Beyond Darkness, there is always Light; How deep are you willing to search?\n\nTHE MISSION\n\nThe ABYSS, presented by Assassins DC and Urban Artistry, offers a new perspective on producing house dance experiences, by focusing on and honoring the most essential elements of house dance culture: the human spirit and cypher participation. We will be conducting qualifiers in cities around the United States culminating in the final ABYSS Cypher Session at the International Soul Society Festival in Washington DC on April 2014. In the process, we hope to inspire a culture of honesty, integrity, self-discovery, and fearlessness, along every participant's journey to evolved artistry.\n\nTHE CONCEPT\n\nAt the start of any house dance experience are the layers within the sound we call house music. These layers are engineered to inspire free movement, cultural enlightenment and artistic growth. Often, unwanted darkness settles on these layers; a darkness made up of doubt, insecurity, fear, and perceived judgment. However, the human spirit's ability to overcome these inner walls, obstacles, and layers is inevitable\u2026 if you believe in yourself. The ABYSS celebrates the cypher as the ultimate space to explore these layers, share these layers, and create more layers, within ourselves and with each other. And so, the ABYSS calls upon Warriors of Light\u2014dancers willing to go deep, to trust their guts, and explore the depths of the layers in and out of the cypher.\n\n\"Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.\u201d Brown\n\n-Bren\u00e9 Brown\n\nTHE FORMAT\n\nPRE-SELECTION\n\nThe pre-selection round will consist of 1-on-1 showcases, with each participant getting one, un-timed run.\n\nDancers, one dancer, or neither dancer will advance.\n\nAn Advisory Committee, made up of the event organizers, local House Dance professionals will choose 12 dancers to advance to the cypher session.\n\nTHE CYPHER SESSION\n\nThe cypher session will be a one-hour cypher of uninterrupted exchanges between the chosen dozen from pre-selection.\n\nJUDGING\n\nThe 12 finalists will choose a winner amongst themselves. Each dancer will have one vote, but cannot vote for himself/herself.\n\nThe dancer with a majority of the votes will be the winner.\n\nShould there be a tie(s), those receiving the highest number of votes will be given a chance to concede to the dancer(s) that they believe is the winner. If the dancers choose to continue, they will return to the cypher for an additional 30 minutes or the final exchange. During this final exchange, all dancers have the right to concede and proclaim the opponent(s) the winner. If no one concedes during or after the final exchange, the Advisory\n\nCommittee will choose a winner from those remaining, based on technique, musicality, originality and artistry.\n\nAWARDING\n\nThe Final Cypher Champion will receive a personalized handmade adornment, handwritten recognition as THE ABYSS 2014 Warrior of Light and $1000.",

He then went on to win statewide elected office in 1993 as attorney general of Virginia.  Then-Attorney General Gilmore led a nationwide effort to stop arson against African-American churches.

Others are ignoring \nthe problems because they have succumbed to hopelessness. Ethiopian National Transitional Council \n(ENTC) believes that losing hope is not an option. The recent ethnic cleansing campaign against Amhara \nfarmers in western Ethiopia, the brutal crackdown of peaceful Muslim protesters who are demanding \nreligious freedom, the arrest of Arena Tigray party members in Tigray, mass arrest of Oromo youth and \ncivilians in Arba Minch, and the continued detentions of journalists, political party leaders and members, \nand religious leaders can all be stopped if freedom loving Ethiopians come together and offer the people \nof Ethiopia an alternative to the ethnic apartheid regime. \nRemoving the TPLF regime and replacing it with an all-inclusive transitional government is a clear-cut \nsolution to the political, economic and social crises that have engulfed our country. \nThe recent nation-wide efforts by UDJ and Semayawi parties to mobilize Ethiopians to assert their \nfreedom are positive steps. ENTC fully supports their endeavours. ENTC is also pleased with the Ethiopian \nMuslim\u2019s peaceful and courageous struggle to stop the TPLF regime\u2019s interference in religious affairs. \nThe logical extension to the efforts that are being made by Ethiopian pro-democracy forces is coming up \nwith an alternative system of governance in Ethiopia. To help facilitate such process, ENTC has been \nholding consultative conferences in various cities since July 2012. \nENTC will hold an important town hall meeting April 13, 2014 in Washington DC where prominent \nscholars, representatives of political and civic groups and religious leaders will discuss their vision on \nremoving and replacing the regime in Ethiopia through a unified struggle. \nGuest speakers include religious leaders Abune Philipos and Sheik Khalid Mohammed; Ustaz Haji Najib, \nAba Gebreselassie Tibebu, Prof. Alemayehu Gebremariam, Dr Kassa Kebede, Journalist Abebe Gelaw and \nENTC speaker Ato Sileshi Tilahun. \nENTC cordially invites all patriotic Ethiopians in the Washington DC area to participate in this important \ntown hall meeting. \nTime/Date: Sunday, April 13, 2014, at 1:30 PM \nPlace: Sheraton Pentagon City, 900 S.

I inherited this tradition and invite you to share it with me this year.  We will tell the story of BST's attempt to go to Israel (because he thought it would bring the messiah) and how he was miraculously saved during the journey. We will also eat matza balls (because that has something to do with the story). Aside from this central story-telling, we will also get to hear other stories as folks bring them: stories of the Baal-Shem-Tov, stories of Rav Nachman of Breslov (his great-grandson), or any of the other thousands of classics that make up the Hasidic story-telling tradition.\n\nThe schedule for the evening will be as follows (feel free to come for some or all): \n5pm - Learning with Shalom \n6pm - Mincha\n6:30pm - Ba'al Shem Tov Seudah\nThe arrival of Moshiach is scheduled for sometime after havdalah\n \nPeople should feel free to bring packaged k-for-p food or fresh (unwaxed and uncut) produce, but food will be provided.  If people want to help set up, please arrive at 4:30pm.   Volunteers to come over and help cook in advance are appreciated.

        "description": "Typically the 4th of July is celebrated with a family barbecue and a nice local fireworks show. But in lieu of the repetitious I would like to suggest an alternative. An occupation so to speak.\n\n  On November the 5th 2013 a non partisan, leaderless movement called the Million Mask March brought together Americans from many different political backgrounds without any infighting to peacefully petition the government for a redress of grievances.  I'm suggesting an occupation of Washington until those grievances are heard, acknowledged and fixed.  We have without any shadow of a doubt lost our freedoms and our bill of rights is all but gone, erased and overridden by new laws like NDAA and the Patriot act in the interest of national security to keep us safe from terrorism\n\nBenjamin Franklin once said ''Those who would sell our freedoms for security deserve neither''. I agree with Benjamin Franklin and believe the proponents of these new unconstitutional bills do not deserve freedom but a lifetime sentence in a federal penitentiary.\n\nOne grievance in particular has undermined our democracy and our republic for a little over a hundred years now. The Federal Reserve is a private bank that has been drowning our country in debt for the benefit of a few. Woodrow Wilson even expressed grief for signing the federal reserve act stating \u201cI am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country. A great industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system of credit is concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore, and all our activities are in the hands of a few men. We have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely controlled and dominated Governments in the civilized world - no longer a Government by free opinion, no longer a Government by conviction and the vote of the majority, but a Government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men.\u201d\n\n Thomas Jefferson said ''I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. If the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation then by deflation, the banks and corporations that grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs.''\n\nThe founders of this nation warned us of the dangers of a central private bank and the apathy of the people towards policy in our govt. Their worst fears have come to fruition and have all but destroyed this country. The american people are down...but not out. We will not go quietly into the night. We will not stand by any longer and see this country of ours and our freedom turn to tyranny. We will fight for what is right and what is ours\n\nI ask you the american people to stand beside us. Starting this July 4th we will occupy our capitol. I expect there will be few at first. But our continued presence in the capitol will show others they are not alone, and before long more will join.  If you are up to your ears in debt, If you are tired and hungry and you see the crimes of this government as we see it then i ask that you join us\n\nBe prepared to accept everybody. Remember that no religious or political belief is inherently evil, they are just tools that we as a society use and that it is how we use and react to these tools that defines us and gives us our morality\n\nMeet at the Washington monument, Bring a tent and a good attitude\n\nNo drugs/alcohol\nNo violence\nNo discrimination",

        "description": "You are invited!  Join us for the LAUNCH of this groundbreaking new event created and designed for diverse aspiring lawyers and leaders!\n\nThe National Diversity Pre-Law Conference and Law Fair's inaugural event will take place on Friday and Saturday, April 4th and April 5th, 2014 at The Washington Court Hotel on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC - conveniently located just minutes walking distance from the U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nThis event will address what diverse law school admissions candidates can do to be more competitive and strategic candidates.  Even more, it will cover the tough issues surrounding diversity in law school admission, in the law school environment and in the legal profession.  \n\nWe will honestly discuss the harsh realities of the changing legal market, the down economy and the current state of legal education.  We want to help diverse aspiring lawyers to better understand the very real obstacles and challenges ahead in law school, in the job search and in the legal profession that could hold them back from being successful if they are unaware of and not ready to take them on.  We want to provide them with tools and strategies to be the very best admissions candidates, law students and lawyers that they can be. \n\nFurther, we want to encourage them to become leaders in the area of diversity so that they will take on and continue the critical work in their law schools and legal work environments to help make them more diverse and inclusive.  The legal profession has been slow to change and lags behind others in maintaining and increasing diversity.  We believe that we all have a role in making meaningful change.\n\nWe aim to give conference attendees access to information, resources and contacts that can help better position them to succeed BEFORE they begin the admissions process or even start law school.  Further, we will impress upon them the importance of not only making a living, but also making a difference.  We will make them aware of opportunities to serve the community and of their social responsibility to have a positive impact on society.\n\nThis conference will provide:\n\n* Workshops and Panels\n* Keynote Speakers\n* Training/Seminars\n* Law School Recruitment Fair\n* Diversity Resources Fair\n* Scheduled Group Visits to the U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court of the United States\n* Community Service Opportunity\n\nALL law schools and organizations that provide programs or services targeting diverse prospective law students are invited to participate.  \n\nWho represents diversity?  Different cultural and social identity groups including: Native Americans, African Americans/Blacks, Asian Pacific Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, Women, Disabled, Sexual Orientation/Gender Identity (LGBT), and Age/Non-Traditional Status.\n\nWe welcome all pre-law students (high school students, college students, college graduates, career changers, working professionals), multicultural/diversity administrators, law students, law graduates, lawyers, law school administrators, law professors, judges, etc.\n\nIf you are a law student, lawyer, bar leader, or diversity professional and you are interested in being involved with this event, please send an e-mail to info@diversityprelawconference.org.\n\nTHIS EVENT IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND COMPLETELY FREE OF CHARGE!\n\nEVERYONE IS WELCOME TO ATTEND!  SPACES ARE LIMITED!\n\nUltimately we hope to provide participants with opportunities to learn not only about law school and the legal profession, but more about the critical areas of:\n* Diversity and Inclusion \n* Coalition Building \n* Cultural Competence \n* Leadership \n* Professionalism \n* Service \n* Social Responsibility\n* Social Justice\n\nREGISTRATION IS FREE!\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-inaugural-national-diversity-pre-law-conference-and-law-fair-2014-tickets-9490942665\n\nSTAY AT THE HOST HOTEL - THE WASHINGTON COURT HOTEL ON CAPITOL HILL IN WASHINGTON, DC!!!\nROOM RATES ARE ONLY $159 per night for single and doubles.\nStandard Single: $159\nStandard Double: $159\nStandard Triple: $184\nStandard Quad: $209\nCall the hotel reservations department at 1-800-321-3010 and ask for a room under \"The National Diversity Pre-Law Conference\" block.",

        "description": "Now since I have everything lined up, I'd like to announce that I have planned a bus trip on May 10, 2014 to the National Zoo in Washington DC.  The cost PER PERSON (from birth to 125 lo, as the price is to reserve a seat on the busl) is $31. This price is for THE BUS ONLY and your seat will not be reserved until I have cash in my hand. We will be departing promptly at 7am on that morning from the parking lot of my husbands work, (I can provide address and/or directions at a later time). And returning no later than 10pm, as long as traffic cooperates.\nAdmission to the zoo is free. The bus will drop off near the gate and will pick everyone back up at the designated time.  You are free to roam DC, you are not restricted to be within the confines of the National Zoo. You may do your own thing as long as you return in time to board the bus back to NJ. If you miss the bus, I hope you have train fare or comfortable shoes. It will be a long walk back home. \nUpon departure from the Zoo, we will be stopping for dinner in Essex, Maryland at Cactus Willies Steak Buffet for dinner. I have made a group reservation to assure they can accomodate us. The dinner price for adults is $14.29 + 0.75 gratuity totalling $15.04. There is a discount for seniors as well as children. What the discount is, I do not know. Their website is cactuswillies.com if you would like more information. I have eaten there a few times, it is a nice place and the food is good. \nI will also be holding a 50/50 raffle on the bus as we travel south, one half to be given to our driver as his tip and the other half to go to some lucky winner.\nAnything you bring with you, I would recommend taking with you as we exit the bus to enter the zoo, as Sheppard Bus Company is NOT liable for anything lost or stolen from the bus. The bus will also have on an board dvd player ans several monitors if anyone would like to bring a dvd or two to share and make the ride a little more bearable for the children in attendance.\nIf you are interested in going, please contact me and make arrangements for payment to reserve your seat(s).\nTHIS TRIP IS IN NO WAY SPONSORED OR ENDORSED BY ANY BUSINESS, GROUP OR IS IT IN ANY WAY, ANY TYPE OF FUNDRAISER. \nI am hoping by word of mouth, we will fill the bus and have a great time at the zoo.",

        "description": "What is your only comfort in life and death?\n\nThis question was raised during the Reformation, when many Protestants sought and found Christian comfort through the rediscovery of a biblical vision of assurance of one's salvation, secured by Christ alone through faith alone. The Reformers feared that medieval forms of Christian piety too often were motivated by doubt of one's salvation, and fear about the coming judgment. Roman Catholic piety, in contrast, emphasized that Christian comfort is experienced through the sacramental life of the church, penitential practices and pilgrimages, and the veneration and mediation of Mary and the Saints. The Roman Church taught that the simplicity of Protestant piety cut the believer off from an abundance of practical supports.\n\nPresenters Dr. Brian Lee, Pastor of Christ Reformed, and Barrett Turner, a doctoral candidate at the Catholic University of America, will present Protestant and Catholic positions on the topic and field audience questions. A casual pizza dinner will be served (RSVP Required), and the event will be jointly presented by Christ Reformed Church, Washington DC and \"Faith Discussion Dinner.\" Please visit www.faithdiscussion.org/home/nextdiscussion.html for more information.\n\nRSVP required for FREE \"We the Pizza\" dinner.

This is real. The club you\u2019re in feels as though the entire building is the VIP area, not just because of the lingerie models wearing black nerd-glasses piling over you to reach another bottle of bubbly, or the gyrating wall-to-wall moshpit that\u2019s the dancefloor. Tonight feels special because the DJs \u2013 the engine of the party \u2013 are rockin\u2019 it like you\u2019ve never imagined. Oh, and they\u2019re wearing matching NASA spacesuits and there\u2019s a six-foot-tall teddy bear onstage hyping the crowd like a maniacal MC. The DJs are MANUFACTURED SUPERSTARS, and tonight is every night.\n\nMANUFACTURED SUPERSTARS are BRADLEY ROULIER and SHAWN SABO. As DJs, their performance style is as high-energy, accessible and fun as it is technically challenging. Although their DJ performances have been described as \u201cmash-up\u201d or \u201copen-format\u201d by many in the music press, what they really do is create a non-stop tornado of happiness when they spin. This can be evidenced by the countless smiling faces in their crowds and the consistently sold-out shows.\n\nThe MANUFACTURED SUPERSTARS have long been technologically savvy, and technology coexists organically in their everyday lives. ROULIER is a co-founder and founding member of leading digital music retailer, BEATPORT.COM. SABO was an original employee of BEATPORT and he remains a member.",

Adebowale Ibibapo Adefuye, Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the U.S. The discussion and Q&A to follow will enable public- and private-sector leaders to better understand what is driving global views of U.S. leadership, create a context for collaboration on how to improve those views, and enhance U.S. public and private global engagement efforts.\n \nMr. Jon Clifton, Managing Director, Gallup World Poll will introduce the event with a presentation of Gallup's latest World Poll, which surveys more than 150 countries that are home to more than 98% of the world's population, with specific insight into: global approval trends of U.S. leadership from the Bush administration to the Obama administration; analysis of the countries with highest and lowest approval of U.S. leadership, and U.S. standing vs. other world leadership; analysis for each major global region -- the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia; and the effect of U.S. foreign policy on global opinion.\n \nBased on more than 1,000 country studies and seven years of data collection, the U.S.-Global Leadership Project is a joint effort to provide a comprehensive assessment of how the global community views U.S. leadership.\n \nRegistration is required at: https://registration.gallup.com/?O=FZC1115AJQ740223RS.

Intimate in style, ELENA delves into the abyss of one family\u02bcs drama, revealing at once the inspiration that can be born from tragedy. \n\nElena, a young Brazilian woman, moves to New York with the same dream her mother had: to become a movie actress. She leaves behind her childhood spent in hiding during the years of the military dictatorship. She also leaves Petra, her seven-year-old sister. The calls and letters trail off, until one day they stop entirely. Two decades later, Petra also becomes an actress and heads to New York. At first in search of her destiny, but increasingly, in search of Elena, Petra has only a few clues: home movies, newspaper clippings, a diary and some letters. Despite the long odds, at any moment, Petra hopes to find Elena walking in the streets. \n\nGradually, the features of the two sisters are confused; we no longer know one from the other. When Petra finally finds Elena in an unexpected place, she has to learn to let her go. ELENA is a film about the persistence of those memories, the irreversibility of that loss, and the impact the absence of her sister had on the seven year-old girl3",

He outbid industry giants on land parcels (which, starting at $2 an acre, were adjacent to national treasures like Canyonlands National Park), winning 22,000 acres of land worth $1.7 million before the auction was halted.\n\nTwo months later, incoming Interior Secretary Ken Salazar invalidated the auction. DeChristopher, however, was indicted on two federal felonies with penalties of up to 10 years in prison and $750,000 in fines. Patrick Shea, former BLM Director for Clinton, represented DeChristopher pro-bono.\n\nWith the threat of prison looming, DeChristopher stepped up his activism and evolved into a charismatic and ingenious climate justice leader. He co-founded Peaceful Uprising, a grass-roots group dedicated to defending a livable future through empowering non-violent action.\n\nAfter two years and nine postponements, his trial began on February 28, 2011. Outside the courtroom, hundreds rallied in solidarity with Tim. Inside, Judge Dee Benson disallowed every defense his lawyers put forth. After a five-day trial, DeChristopher was found guilty. His sentencing was scheduled for summer 2011.\n\nRefusing to back down, Tim flew to D.C. in April 2011 to give a keynote speech at Power Shift 2011 in front of 10,000 students. He then led students to occupy the Department of the Interior. Tim wisely avoided arrest, but dozens of others were arrested for this mass act of peaceful civil disobedience.\n\nOn July 26th Tim was sentenced to two years in federal prison and removed immediately from court in chains.\n\nSponsored by:\nD.C.

        "description": "You are invited to attend a special presentation by Pastor Steve Khoury from Bethlehem this Wednesday, March 26 at 7 p.m. (Living Word's Wednesday night service.)\n\nPastor Khoury is a frequent speaker at CUFI's Washington, D.C. Annual Summit. He and his father are among the very few Palestinian Christians who support Israel. His father, Dr. Naim Khoury, had established a ministry in 1980. Today they are spreading the gospel throughout the Palestinian Territories and in Jerusalem, he pastors Calvary Baptist Church.\n\nIlan Sharon, our Israeli Jewish friend will join us as well to share about the special relationship he has with Pastor Khoury.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE for attendees who are not Living Word members: The presentation is part of Living Word's weekly Wednesday night service and will include Christian Praise and Worship in the first 15 minutes and the message from Pastor Khoury is a strong message of Christian faith, however, we believe it is great source of education to anyone that is interested in Israel and the story of the Christian minority living in Palestinian controlled area.\n\nThe Church has (as part of their regular Wednesday night service) Christian childcare for newborns thru 5th grade. The sanctuary also has balcony area which is great for families.\n \nWhat: A Taste of CUFI's Washington, D.C.

Several believers under his ministry have been martyred, including his own uncle, and several youth girls who invited children to vacation bible school. Persecution has always faced Pastor Khoury's life growing up as an Arab pastor during the intifadas.\n \nPastor Steven Khoury is the Vice President of Holy Land Missions, which has been reaching out to the lost in Israel for the past 30 years. Today, six locations around the country are actively serving the community and preaching the Gospel, including Calvary Church in Jerusalem and First Baptist in Bethlehem.\n \nPastor Khoury attended Bible College in Springfield, Missouri, where he received his Bachelor of Science in Pastoral Ministry and Theology. He is an affiliate with the Baptist Bible Fellowship International, the National Christian Foundation, and the Voice of the Martyrs Organization. He is the youngest ordained Israeli Arab pastor in Israel and the surrounding Arab countries.\n \nPastor Khoury is author of the book, Diplomatic Christianity: Standing in the Shadow of Tomorrow's Persecution. His ministry has been a topic in several books. Steven has also done numerous interviews, including recent broadcasts on FOX News and CBN.",

        "description": "The Get Right Band Rocks Solly's in DC! Come on out and shake something!\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEgJmc6IYaY\n\nThe Get Right Band:\n\nOne of Relix Magazine\u2019s \u201cOn The Verge\u201d picks, THE GET RIGHT BAND is \u201chip-shaking, earthquaking pure funk fun\u201d (The Alternate Root). Combining catchy, clever songwriting with musical expertise and fearless improvisation, the live show promises to make you shake everything you\u2019ve got. From funk to rock n\u2019 roll to reggae, this is a dance party. This is an ass shaking good time.\n\n\u201cThe Get Right Band is a three-piece with the musical energy and power of The Police,\u201d says Rock and Roll Hall of Famer and legendary Lynyrd Skynyrd drummer Artimus Pyle. The Transylvania Times writes that the band \u201ctakes the stage with a palpable sense of energy.\u201d\n\nThe band is built on the musical brotherhood that guitarist/vocalist Silas Durocher and bassist Jesse Gentry have formed playing music together since middle school. With the addition of Jian-Claude Mears, a powerful and dynamic drummer, the group\u2019s sound has become an unstoppable force. The Get Right Band has been touring the East Coast and the Caribbean heavily since their inception in April, 2011. The band has rocked hard and jammed relentlessly every step of the way.\n\nThe Get Right Band\u2019s debut CD, Shake, was released in February, 2013. Hittin\u2019 The Note Magazine says the disc is \u201cfun, full of energy and excitement, and should be listened to with the volume turned all the way up.\u201d The rock n\u2019 roll album features stripped down but creatively layered and produced performances of the band\u2019s original tunes. It\u2019s \u201cgroove with rock melodies built on funk attitudes,\u201d says The Mountain Xpress. From the seductive blues of \u201cVoodoo Doll\u201d to the dance party vibe of \u201cChromaticize\u201d to the Caribbean influenced \u201cTouch The Holy,\u201d (inspired by the band\u2019s Caribbean tours) Shake\u2019s \u201cimpressive stylistic range manages to all fit within the band\u2019s distinctive image\u201d (WNC Magazine). The Grateful Web writes that the disc is a \u201ctasty mix of hip-swinging selections that leaves the listener thirsty for more.\u201d\n\nThe members of The Get Right Band have played with many of the East Coast\u2019s greatest acts, including Laura Reed and Deep Pocket, Woody Wood, Josh Phillips, The Artimus Pyle Band, Scrappy Hamilton (now Truth & Salvage Company), Afromotive, and Royal Trux (Virgin Records), and have shared the stage with national acts such as Galactic, Victor Wooten Band, Mike Dillon Band, Jeff Sipe Trio, Yo Mama\u2019s Big Fat Booty Band, Jeff Coffin\u2019s Mutet, Larry Keel, and Bobby Lee Rodgers.\n\nWebsite: www.thegetrightband.com",
